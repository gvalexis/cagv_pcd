hands should rub each others shoulderblades\\nand be content\\n\\nagain i always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point of\\npaying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a single\\npenny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves must\\npay and there is all the difference in the world between paying and\\nbeing paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable\\ninfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us but _being\\npaid_what will compare with it the urbane activity with which a man\\nreceives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly\\nbelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no\\naccount can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign\\nourselves to perdition\\n\\nfinally i always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome\\nexercise and pure air of the forecastle deck for as in this world\\nhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is if\\nyou never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the\\ncommodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\\nthe sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but not\\nso in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many\\nother things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it but\\nwherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a\\nmerchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling\\nvoyage this the invisible police officer of the fates who has the\\nconstant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me in\\nsome unaccountable wayhe can better answer than any one else and\\ndoubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand\\nprogramme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago it came in\\nas a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive\\nperformances i take it that this part of the bill must have run\\nsomething like this\\n\\n_grand contested election for the presidency of the united states_\\nwhaling voyage by one ishmael bloody battle in affghanistan\\n\\nthough i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers the\\nfates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when\\nothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short\\nand easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in farcesthough i\\ncannot tell why this was exactly yet now that i recall all the\\ncircumstances i think i can see a little into the springs and motives\\nwhich being cunningly presented to me under various disguises induced\\nme to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the\\ndelusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill\\nand discriminating judgment\\n\\nchief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale\\nhimself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my\\ncuriosity then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island\\nbulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with all\\nthe attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds\\nhelped to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such things\\nwould not have been inducements but as for me i am tormented with an\\neverlasting itch for things remote i love to sail forbidden seas and\\nland on

ere i could embark for my destined port it became a\\nmatter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile it was a\\nvery dubiouslooking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold\\nand cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels i had\\nsounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silverso\\nwherever you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of\\na dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the\\nnorth with the darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom you\\nmay conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to\\ninquire the price and dont be too particular\\n\\nwith halting steps i paced the streets and passed the sign of the\\ncrossed harpoonsbut it looked too expensive and jolly there further\\non from the bright red windows of the swordfish inn there came\\nsuch fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and\\nice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay\\nten inches thick in a hard asphaltic pavementrather weary for me\\nwhen i struck my foot against the flinty projections because from\\nhard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most\\nmiserable plight too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one\\nmoment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of\\nthe tinkling glasses within but go on ishmael said i at last dont\\nyou hear get away from before the door your patched boots are\\nstopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the streets\\nthat took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not\\nthe cheeriest inns\\n\\nsuch dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand\\nand here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at\\nthis hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of\\nthe town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light\\nproceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood\\ninvitingly open it had a careless look as if it were meant for the\\nuses of the public so entering the first thing i did was to stumble\\nover an ashbox in the porch ha thought i ha as the flying\\nparticles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city\\ngomorrah but the crossed harpoons and the swordfishthis then\\nmust needs be the sign of the trap however i picked myself up and\\nhearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interior\\ndoor\\n\\nit seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black\\nfaces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel of\\ndoom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the\\npreachers text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping\\nand wailing and teethgnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing\\nout wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap\\n\\nmoving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the\\ndocks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a\\nswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly\\nrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words\\nunderneaththe spouter innpeter coffin\\n\\ncoffinspouterrather ominous in that particular connexion thought\\ni but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this\\npeter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim and\\nthe place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated\\nlittle wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here\\nfrom the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a\\npovertystricken sort of creak to it i thought that here was the very\\nspot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee\\n\\nit was a queer sort of placea gableended old house one side palsied\\nas it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner\\nwhere that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than\\never it did about poor pauls tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless\\nis a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one indoors with his feet on the\\nhob quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind\\ncalled euroclydon says an old writerof whose works i possess the\\nonly copy extantit maketh a marvellous difference whether thou\\nlookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the\\noutside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where\\nthe frost is on both sides and of which the wight death is the only\\nglazier true enough thought i as this passage occurred to my\\nmindold blackletter thou reasonest well yes these eyes are\\nwindows and this body of mine is the house what a pity they didnt\\nstop up the chinks and the crannies though and thrust in a little lint\\nhere and there but its too late to make any improvements now the\\nuniverse is finished the copestone is on and the chips were carted\\noff a million years ago poor lazarus there chattering his teeth\\nagainst the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off his tatters with\\nhis shiverings he might plug up both ears with rags and put a\\ncorncob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the\\ntempestuous euroclydon euroclydon says old dives in his red silken\\nwrapperhe had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what a fine frosty\\nnight how orion glitters what northern lights let them talk of their\\noriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give me the\\nprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals\\n\\nbut what thinks lazarus can he warm his blue

go down to the fiery pit itself in\\norder to keep out this frost\\n\\nnow that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the\\ndoor of dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be\\nmoored to one of the moluccas yet dives himself he too lives like a\\nczar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a\\ntemperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans\\n\\nbut no more of this blubbering now we are going awhaling and there\\nis plenty of that yet to come let us scrape the ice from our frosted\\nfeet and see what sort of a place this spouter may be\\n\\n\\nchapter 3 the spouterinn\\n\\nentering that gableended spouterinn you found yourself in a wide\\nlow straggling entry with oldfashioned wainscots reminding one of\\nthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large\\noilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the\\nunequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligent\\nstudy and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of\\nthe neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\\npurpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first\\nyou almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new\\nengland hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint\\nof much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and\\nespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the\\nentry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however\\nwild might not be altogether unwarranted\\n\\nbut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber\\nportentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\\npicture over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a\\nnameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive\\na nervous man distracted yet was there a sort of indefinite\\nhalfattained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to\\nit till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what\\nthat marvellous painting meant ever and anon a bright but alas\\ndeceptive idea would dart you throughits the black sea in a midnight\\ngaleits the unnatural combat of the four primal elementsits a\\nblasted heathits a hyperborean winter sceneits the breakingup of\\nthe icebound stream of time but at last all these fancies yielded to\\nthat one portentous something in the pictures midst _that_ once found\\nout and all the rest were plain but stop does it not bear a faint\\nresemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself\\n\\nin fact the artists design seemed this a final theory of my own\\npartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\\nwhom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a capehorner\\nin a great hurricane the halffoundered ship weltering there with its\\nthree dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale\\npurposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of\\nimpaling himself upon the three mastheads\\n\\nthe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\\narray of monstrous clubs and spears some were thickly set with\\nglittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knots\\nof human hair and one was sickleshaped with a vast handle sweeping\\nround like the segment made in the newmown grass by a longarmed\\nmower you shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal\\nand savage could ever have gone a deathharvesting with such a hacking\\nhorrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances\\nand harpoons all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with\\nthis once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did nathan\\nswain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset and that\\nharpoonso like a corkscrew nowwas flung in javan seas and run away\\nwith by a whale years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the\\noriginal iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle\\nsojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty feet and at last\\nwas found imbedded in the hump\\n\\ncrossing this dusky entry and on through yon lowarched waycut\\nthrough what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\\nfireplaces all roundyou enter the public room a still duskier place\\nis this with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled\\nplanks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old crafts\\ncockpits especially of such a howling night when this corneranchored\\nold ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelflike\\ntable covered with cracked glass cases filled with dusty rarities\\ngathered from this wide worlds remotest nooks projecting from the\\nfurther angle of the room stands a darklooking denthe bara rude\\nattempt at a right whales head be that how it may there stands the\\nvast arched bone of the whales jaw so wide a coach might almost\\ndrive beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old\\ndecanters bottles flasks and in those jaws of swift destruction\\nlike another cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him\\nbustles a little withered old man who for their money dearly sells\\nthe sailors deliriums and death\\n\\nabominable are the tumblers into which he

surround these footpads goblets fill to\\n_this_ mark and your charge is but a penny to _this_ a penny more\\nand so on to the full glassthe cape horn measure which you may gulp\\ndown for a shilling\\n\\nupon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about\\na table examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_ i\\nsought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with\\na room received for answer that his house was fullnot a bed\\nunoccupied but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no\\nobjections to sharing a harpooneers blanket have ye i spose you are\\ngoin awhalin so youd better get used to that sort of thing\\n\\ni told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should\\never do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that\\nif he the landlord really had no other place for me and the\\nharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander\\nfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with\\nthe half of any decent mans blanket\\n\\ni thought so all right take a seat supperyou want supper\\nsupperll be ready directly\\n\\ni sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the\\nbattery at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with\\nhis jackknife stooping over and diligently working away at the space\\nbetween his legs he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail but\\nhe didnt make much headway i thought\\n\\nat last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\\nadjoining room it was cold as icelandno fire at allthe landlord said\\nhe couldnt afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candles each in a\\nwinding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jackets and hold\\nto our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers but the\\nfare was of the most substantial kindnot only meat and potatoes but\\ndumplings good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in a\\ngreen box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\\nmanner\\n\\nmy boy said the landlord youll have the nightmare to a dead\\nsartainty\\n\\nlandlord i whispered that aint the harpooneer is it\\n\\noh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the\\nharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings he\\ndonthe eats nothing but steaks and he likes em rare\\n\\nthe devil he does says i where is that harpooneer is he here\\n\\nhell be here afore long was the answer\\n\\ni could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark\\ncomplexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so\\nturned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into\\nbed before i did\\n\\nsupper over the company went back to the barroom when knowing not\\nwhat else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the\\nevening as a looker on\\n\\npresently a rioting noise was heard without starting up the landlord\\ncried thats the grampuss crew i seed her reported in the offing\\nthis morning a three years voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now\\nwell have the latest news from the feegees\\n\\na tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flung\\nopen and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough enveloped in their\\nshaggy watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters\\nall bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they\\nseemed an eruption of bears from labrador they had just landed from\\ntheir boat and this was the first house they entered no wonder then\\nthat they made a straight wake for the whales mouththe barwhen the\\nwrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out\\nbrimmers all round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon\\nwhich jonah mixed him a pitchlike potion of gin and molasses which he\\nswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever never\\nmind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador\\nor on the weather side of an iceisland\\n\\nthe liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does even\\nwith the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they began\\ncapering about most obstreperously\\n\\ni observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though\\nhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\\nown sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\\nnoise as the rest this man interested me at once and since the\\nseagods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though\\nbut a sleepingpartner one so far as this narrative is concerned i\\nwill here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six\\nfeet in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a cofferdam i\\nhave seldom seen such brawn in a man his face was deeply brown and\\nburnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the\\ndeep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem\\nto give him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a\\nsoutherner and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of\\nthose tall mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when\\nthe revelry of his companions had mounted to its height this man\\nslipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my\\ncomrade on the sea in a few minutes however he was missed by his\\nshipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with\\nthem they raised a cry of bulkington bulkington wheres\\nbulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of him\\n\\nit was now about nine oclock and the room seeming almost\\nsupernaturally quiet after these orgies i began to congratulate myself\\nupon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the\\nentrance of the seamen\\n\\nno man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal\\nrather not sleep with your own brother i dont know how it is but\\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping and when it comes to\\nsleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town\\nand that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely\\nmultiply nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should\\nsleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep\\ntwo in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they all\\nsleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and\\ncover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin\\n\\nthe more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the\\nthought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being a\\nharpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of\\nthe tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over\\nbesides it was getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home\\nand going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at\\nmidnighthow could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming\\n\\nlandlord ive changed my mind about that harpooneeri shant sleep\\nwith him ill try the bench here\\n\\njust as you please im sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\\nmattress and its a plaguy rough board herefeeling of the knots and\\nnotches but wait a bit skrimshander ive got a carpenters plane\\nthere in the barwait i say and ill make ye snug enough so saying\\nhe procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\\nthe bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning\\nlike an ape the shavings flew right and left till at last the\\nplaneiron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord was\\nnear spraining his wrist and i told him for heavens sake to quitthe\\nbed was soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing\\nin the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the\\nshavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in\\nthe middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a\\nbrown study\\n\\ni now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too\\nshort but that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot too\\nnarrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\\nthan the planed oneso there was no yoking them i then placed the\\nfirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall\\nleaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i\\nsoon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from\\nunder the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all\\nespecially as another current from the rickety door met the one from\\nthe window and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\\nthe immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the\\nnight\\n\\nthe devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldnt i steal\\na march on himbolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be\\nwakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea but upon\\nsecond thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next\\nmorning so soon as i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be\\nstanding in the entry all ready to knock me down\\n\\nstill looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of\\nspending a sufferable night unless in some other persons bed i began\\nto think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\\nagainst this unknown harpooneer thinks i ill wait awhile he must be\\ndropping in before long ill have a good look at him then and perhaps\\nwe may become jolly good bedfellows after alltheres no telling\\n\\nbut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes\\nand going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer\\n\\nlandlord said i what sort of a chap is hedoes he always keep such\\nlate hours it was now hard upon twelve oclock\\n\\nthe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be\\nmightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he\\nanswered generally hes an early birdairley to bed and airley to\\nriseyes hes the bird what catches the worm but tonight he went out\\na peddling you see and i dont see what on airth keeps him so late\\nunless may be he cant sell his head\\n\\ncant sell his headwhat sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are\\ntelling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say\\nlandlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\\nsaturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around\\nthis town\\n\\nthats precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldnt\\nsell it here the markets overstocked\\n\\nwith what shouted i\\n\\nwith heads to be sure aint there too many heads in the world\\n\\ni tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly youd better\\nstop spinning that yarn to meim not green\\n\\nmay be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i\\nrayther guess youll be done _brown_ if that ere harpooneer hears you a\\nslanderin his head\\n\\nill break it for him said i now flying into a passion again at\\nthis unaccountable farrago of the landlords\\n\\nits broke aready said he\\n\\nbroke said i_broke_ do you mean\\n\\nsartain and thats the very reason he cant sell it i guess\\n\\nlandlord said i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in a\\nsnowstormlandlord stop whittling you and i must understand one\\nanother and that too without delay i come to your house and want a\\nbed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half\\nbelongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i have\\nnot yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\\nexasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\\ntowards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexion\\nlandlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\\ndegree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\\nharpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the\\nnight with him and in the first place you will be so good as to unsay\\nthat story about selling his head which if true i take to be good\\nevidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and ive no idea of\\nsleeping with a madman and you sir _you_ i mean landlord _you_\\nsir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render\\nyourself liable to a criminal prosecution\\n\\nwall said the landlord fetching a long breath thats a purty long\\nsarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then but be easy be\\neasy this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of has just arrived\\nfrom the south seas where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealand\\nheads great curios you know and hes sold all on em but one and\\nthat one hes trying to sell tonight cause tomorrows sunday and it\\nwould not do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks is\\ngoin to churches he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just as\\nhe was goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string for\\nall the airth like a string of inions\\n\\nthis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed\\nthat the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling mebut at the\\nsame time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\\nsaturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal\\nbusiness as selling the heads of dead idolators\\n\\ndepend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man\\n\\nhe pays reglar was the rejoinder but come its getting dreadful\\nlate you had better be turning flukesits a nice bed sal and me\\nslept in that ere bed the night we were spliced theres plenty of room\\nfor two to kick about in that bed its an almighty big bed that why\\nafore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the\\nfoot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and\\nsomehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm\\narter that sal said it wouldnt do come along here ill give ye a\\nglim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards\\nme offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a\\nclock in the corner he exclaimed i vum its sundayyou wont see that\\nharpooneer tonight hes come to anchor somewherecome along then\\n_do_ come _wont_ ye come\\n\\ni considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i was\\nushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough\\nwith a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four\\nharpooneers to sleep abreast\\n\\nthere said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest\\nthat did double duty as a washstand and centre table there make\\nyourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from\\neyeing the bed but he had disappeared\\n\\nfolding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of\\nthe most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then\\nglanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table\\ncould see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf\\nthe four walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a\\nwhale of things not properly belonging to the room there was a\\nhammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a\\nlarge seamans bag containing the harpooneers wardrobe no doubt in\\nlieu of a land trunk likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bone\\nfish hooks on the shelf over the fireplace and a tall harpoon\\nstanding at the head of the bed\\n\\nbut what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the\\nlight and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to\\narrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it\\nto nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little\\ntinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\\nindian moccasin there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat as\\nyou see the same in south american ponchos but could it be possible\\nthat any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the\\nstreets of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to\\ntry it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy\\nand thick and i thought a little damp as though this mysterious\\nharpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit\\nof glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my\\nlife i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink\\nin the neck\\n\\ni sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this\\nheadpeddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on\\nthe bedside i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in\\nthe middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought a\\nlittle more in my shirt sleeves but beginning to feel very cold now\\nhalf undressed as i was and remembering what the landlord said about\\nthe harpooneers not coming home at all that night it being so very\\nlate i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots\\nand then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself\\nto the care of heaven\\n\\nwhether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery\\nthere is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not\\nsleep for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had\\npretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard\\na heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into\\nthe room from under the door\\n\\nlord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernal\\nheadpeddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word\\ntill spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new\\nzealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without\\nlooking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on\\nthe floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted\\ncords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room i was\\nall eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time\\nwhile employed in unlacing the bags mouth this accomplished however\\nhe turned roundwhen good heavens what a sight such a face it was\\nof a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over with\\nlarge blackish looking squares yes its just as i thought hes a\\nterrible bedfellow hes been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here\\nhe is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his\\nface so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be\\nstickingplasters at all those black squares on his cheeks they were\\nstains of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of this\\nbut soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story\\nof a white mana whaleman toowho falling among the cannibals had\\nbeen tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course\\nof his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure and\\nwhat is it thought i after all its only his outside a man can be\\nhonest in any sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly\\ncomplexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completely\\nindependent of the squares of tattooing to be sure it might be\\nnothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot\\nsuns tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i had\\nnever been in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produced these\\nextraordinary effects upon the skin now while all these ideas were\\npassing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me at\\nall but after some difficulty having opened his bag he commenced\\nfumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a\\nsealskin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in\\nthe middle of the room he then took the new zealand heada ghastly\\nthing enoughand crammed it down into the bag he now took off his\\nhata new beaver hatwhen i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise\\nthere was no hair on his headnone to speak of at leastnothing but a\\nsmall scalpknot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head now\\nlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger\\nstood between me and the door i would have bolted out of it quicker\\nthan ever i bolted a dinner\\n\\neven as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window but\\nit was the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of this\\nheadpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension\\nignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and\\nconfounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid of\\nhim as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\\nthe dead of night in fact i was so afraid of him that i was not game\\nenough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer\\nconcerning what seemed inexplicable in him\\n\\nmeanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed\\nhis chest and arms as i live these covered parts of him were\\ncheckered with the same squares as his face his back too was all\\nover the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty years\\nwar and just escaped from it with a stickingplaster shirt still\\nmore his very legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs\\nwere running up the trunks of young palms it was now quite plain that\\nhe must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman\\nin the south seas and so landed in this christian country i quaked to\\nthink of it a peddler of heads tooperhaps the heads of his own\\nbrothers he might take a fancy to mineheavens look at that tomahawk\\n\\nbut there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about\\nsomething that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me\\nthat he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall\\nor dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in\\nthe pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image\\nwith a hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three days old\\ncongo baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought\\nthat this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar\\nmanner but seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glistened\\na good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing\\nbut a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage\\ngoes up to the empty fireplace and removing the papered fireboard\\nsets up this little hunchbacked image like a tenpin between the\\nandirons the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty\\nso that i thought this fireplace made a very appropriate little shrine\\nor chapel for his congo idol\\n\\ni now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but\\nill at ease meantimeto see what was next to follow first he takes\\nabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places\\nthem carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\\ntop and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings into\\na sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatches into the\\nfire and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed\\nto be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the\\nbiscuit then blowing off the heat and ashes a little he made a polite\\noffer of it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to\\nfancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips all these\\nstrange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from\\nthe devotee who seemed to be praying in a singsong or else singing\\nsome pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in\\nthe most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the\\nidol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket\\nas carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock\\n\\nall these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and seeing\\nhim now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\\noperations and jumping into bed with me i thought it was high time\\nnow or never before the light was put out to break the spell in which\\ni had so long been bound\\n\\nbut the interval i spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one\\ntaking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for\\nan instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the\\nhandle he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke the next moment\\nthe light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between\\nhis teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it\\nnow and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me\\n\\nstammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him\\nagainst the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might\\nbe to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his\\nguttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my\\nmeaning\\n\\nwhoe debel youhe at last saidyou no speake damme i kille\\nand so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the\\ndark\\n\\nlandlord for gods sake peter coffin shouted i landlord watch\\ncoffin angels save me\\n\\nspeake tellee me whoee be or damme i kille again growled the\\ncannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the\\nhot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire\\nbut thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light\\nin hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him\\n\\ndont be afraid now said he grinning again queequeg here wouldnt\\nharm a hair of your head\\n\\nstop your grinning shouted i and why didnt you tell me that that\\ninfernal harpooneer was a cannibal\\n\\ni thought ye knowd itdidnt i tell ye he was a peddlin heads\\naround townbut turn flukes again and go to sleep queequeg look\\nhereyou sabbee me i sabbeeyou this man sleepe youyou sabbee\\n\\nme sabbee plentygrunted queequeg puffing away at his pipe and\\nsitting up in bed\\n\\nyou gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and\\nthrowing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a\\ncivil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a\\nmoment for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely\\nlooking cannibal whats all this fuss i have been making about\\nthought i to myselfthe mans a human being just as i am he has just\\nas much reason to fear me as i have to be afraid of him better sleep\\nwith a sober cannibal than a drunken christian\\n\\nlandlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or\\nwhatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will\\nturn in with him but i dont fancy having a man smoking in bed with\\nme its dangerous besides i aint insured\\n\\nthis being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely\\nmotioned me to get into bedrolling over to one side as much as to\\nsayi wont touch a leg of ye\\n\\ngood night landlord said i you may go\\n\\ni turned in and never slept better in my life\\n\\n\\nchapter 4 the counterpane\\n\\nupon waking next morning about daylight i found queequegs arm thrown\\nover me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost\\nthought i had been his wife the counterpane was of patchwork full of\\nodd little particoloured squares and triangles and this arm of his\\ntattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure no\\ntwo parts of which were of one precise shadeowing i suppose to his\\nkeeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt\\nsleeves irregularly rolled up at various timesthis same arm of his i\\nsay looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork\\nquilt indeed partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke i\\ncould hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hues\\ntogether and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i\\ncould tell that queequeg was hugging me\\n\\nmy sensations were strange let me try to explain them when i was a\\nchild i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me\\nwhether it was a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle the\\ncircumstance was this i had been cutting up some caper or otheri\\nthink it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a little\\nsweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other\\nwas all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperlessmy\\nmother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\\nbed though it was only two oclock in the afternoon of the 21st june\\nthe longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but\\nthere was no help for it so up stairs i went to my little room in the\\nthird floor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time\\nand with a bitter sigh got between the sheets\\n\\ni lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\\nbefore i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hours in bed the small\\nof my back ached to think of it and it was so light too the sun\\nshining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches in the\\nstreets and the sound of gay voices all over the house i felt worse\\nand worseat last i got up dressed and softly going down in my\\nstockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself at\\nher feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\\nslippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to\\nlie abed such an unendurable length of time but she was the best and\\nmost conscientious of stepmothers and back i had to go to my room for\\nseveral hours i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than\\ni have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes\\nat last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and\\nslowly waking from ithalf steeped in dreamsi opened my eyes and the\\nbefore sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt\\na shock running through all my frame nothing was to be seen and\\nnothing was to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine\\nmy arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable\\nsilent form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely\\nseated by my bedside for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there\\nfrozen with the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet\\never thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid\\nspell would be broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided\\naway from me but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it\\nall and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in\\nconfounding attempts to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i\\noften puzzle myself with it\\n\\nnow take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the\\nsupernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to\\nthose which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequegs pagan arm\\nthrown round me but at length all the past nights events soberly\\nrecurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive to\\nthe comical predicament for though i tried to move his armunlock his\\nbridegroom claspyet sleeping as he was he still hugged me tightly\\nas though naught but death should part us twain i now strove to rouse\\nhimqueequegbut his only answer was a snore i then rolled over my\\nneck feeling as if it were in a horsecollar and suddenly felt a\\nslight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk\\nsleeping by the savages side as if it were a hatchetfaced baby a\\npretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the\\nbroad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequegin the name of\\ngoodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and\\nloud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\\nhugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in\\nextracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself\\nall over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in\\nbed stiff as a pikestaff looking at me and rubbing his eyes as if\\nhe did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim\\nconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\\nhim meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings\\nnow and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when at\\nlast his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow\\nand he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon\\nthe floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that\\nif it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress\\nafterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself thinks i queequeg\\nunder the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but the\\ntruth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what you\\nwill it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this\\nparticular compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much\\ncivility and consideration while i was guilty of great rudeness\\nstaring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions for\\nthe time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless\\na man like queequeg you dont see every day he and his ways were well\\nworth unusual regarding\\n\\nhe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall\\none by the by and thenstill minus his trowsershe hunted up his\\nboots what under the heavens he did it for i cannot tell but his\\nnext movement was to crush himselfboots in hand and hat onunder the\\nbed when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings i inferred he\\nwas hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i\\never heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his\\nboots but queequeg do you see was a creature in the transition\\nstageneither caterpillar nor butterfly he was just enough civilized\\nto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners his\\neducation was not yet completed he was an undergraduate if he had not\\nbeen a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled\\nhimself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savage\\nhe never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on at\\nlast he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\\nhis eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if not\\nbeing much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide\\nonesprobably not made to order eitherrather pinched and tormented him\\nat the first go off of a bitter cold morning\\n\\nseeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that the\\nstreet being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view\\ninto the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\\nqueequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boots on\\ni begged him as well as i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat and\\nparticularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible he\\ncomplied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the\\nmorning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to my\\namazement contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\\nchest arms and hands he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a\\npiece of hard soap on the washstand centre table dipped it into water\\nand commenced lathering his face i was watching to see where he kept\\nhis razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed\\ncorner slips out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it\\na little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the\\nwall begins a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheeks\\nthinks i queequeg this is using rogerss best cutlery with a\\nvengeance afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came\\nto know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how\\nexceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept\\n\\nthe rest of his toilet was soon achieved and he proudly marched out of\\nthe room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his\\nharpoon like a marshals baton\\n\\n\\nchapter 5 breakfast\\n\\ni quickly followed suit and descending into the barroom accosted the\\ngrinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malice towards him\\nthough he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my\\nbedfellow\\n\\nhowever a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a\\ngood thing the mores the pity so if any one man in his own proper\\nperson afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be\\nbackward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in\\nthat way and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about\\nhim be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for\\n\\nthe barroom was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the\\nnight previous and whom i had not as yet had a good look at they were\\nnearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates and third mates\\nand sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and\\nharpooneers and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky\\nbeards an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morning\\ngowns\\n\\nyou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore this\\nyoung fellows healthy cheek is like a suntoasted pear in hue and\\nwould seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three days\\nlanded from his indian voyage that man next him looks a few shades\\nlighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the\\ncomplexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly\\nbleached withal _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore but who\\ncould show a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tints\\nseemed like the andes western slope to show forth in one array\\ncontrasting climates zone by zone\\n\\ngrub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we\\nwent to breakfast\\n\\nthey say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease\\nin manner quite selfpossessed in company not always though\\nledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch\\none of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor but\\nperhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as\\nledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in\\nthe negro heart of africa which was the sum of poor mungos\\nperformancesthis kind of travel i say may not be the very best mode\\nof attaining a high social polish still for the most part that sort\\nof thing is to be had anywhere\\n\\nthese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that\\nafter we were all seated at the table and i was preparing to hear some\\ngood stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every man\\nmaintained a profound silence and not only that but they looked\\nembarrassed yes here were a set of seadogs many of whom without the\\nslightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seasentire\\nstrangers to themand duelled them dead without winking and yet here\\nthey sat at a social breakfast tableall of the same calling all of\\nkindred tasteslooking round as sheepishly at each other as though they\\nhad never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green\\nmountains a curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior\\nwhalemen\\n\\nbut as for queequegwhy queequeg sat there among themat the head of\\nthe table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle to be sure i\\ncannot say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have\\ncordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him\\nand using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it\\nto the imminent jeopardy of many heads and grappling the beefsteaks\\ntowards him but _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him and\\nevery one knows that in most peoples estimation to do anything coolly\\nis to do it genteelly\\n\\nwe will not speak of all queequegs peculiarities here how he eschewed\\ncoffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention to\\nbeefsteaks done rare enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew\\nlike the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawkpipe and was\\nsitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat\\non when i sallied out for a stroll\\n\\n\\nchapter 6 the street\\n\\nif i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish\\nan individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a\\ncivilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first\\ndaylight stroll through the streets of new bedford\\n\\nin thoroughfares nigh the docks any

myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called\\nbearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm entering i found\\na small scattered congregation of sailors and sailors wives and\\nwidows a muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks\\nof the storm each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart\\nfrom the other as if each silent grief were insular and\\nincommunicable the chaplain had not yet arrived and there these\\nsilent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble\\ntablets with black borders masoned into the wall on

certain venerable\\nrobustness entered immediately as the stormpelted door flew back upon\\nadmitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation\\nsufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain yes it\\nwas the famous father mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he\\nwas a very great favourite he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in\\nhis youth but for many years past had dedicated his life to the\\nministry at the time i now write of father mapple was in the hardy\\nwinter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging\\ninto a second flowering youth for among all the fissures of his\\nwrinkles there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing\\nbloomthe spring verdure peeping forth even beneath februarys snow no\\none having previously heard his history could for the first time\\nbehold father mapple without the utmost interest because there were\\ncertain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him imputable to that\\nadventurous maritime life he had led when he entered i observed that\\nhe carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage for\\nhis tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilot\\ncloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of\\nthe water it had absorbed however hat and coat and overshoes were one\\nby one removed and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner\\nwhen arrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpit\\n\\nlike most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and since a\\nregular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with the\\nfloor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the\\narchitect it seemed had acted upon the hint of father mapple and\\nfinished the pulpit without a stairs substituting a perpendicular side\\nladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea the wife\\nof a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of\\nred worsted manropes for this ladder which being itself nicely\\nheaded and stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance\\nconsidering what manner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad\\ntaste halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both\\nhands grasping the ornamental knobs of the manropes father mapple\\ncast a look upwards and then with a truly sailorlike but still\\nreverential dexterity hand over hand mounted the steps as if\\nascending the maintop of his vessel\\n\\nthe perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case\\nwith swinging ones were of clothcovered rope only the rounds were of\\nwood so that at every step there was a joint at my first glimpse of\\nthe pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship\\nthese joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary for i was not\\nprepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly turn\\nround and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder\\nstep by step till the whole was deposited within leaving him\\nimpregnable in his little quebec\\n\\ni pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this\\nfather mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\\nsanctity that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\\nmere tricks of the stage no thought i there must be some sober\\nreason for this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen\\ncan it be then that by that act of physical isolation he signifies\\nhis spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly ties\\nand connexions yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the\\nword to the faithful man of god this pulpit i see is a\\nselfcontaining strongholda lofty ehrenbreitstein with a perennial\\nwell of water within the walls\\n\\nbut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place\\nborrowed from the chaplains former seafarings between the marble\\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back\\nwas adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating\\nagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy\\nbreakers but high above the flying scud and darkrolling clouds there\\nfloated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angels\\nface and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\\nships tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into\\nthe victorys plank where nelson fell ah noble ship the angel\\nseemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy\\nhelm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling\\noffserenest azure is at hand\\n\\nnor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same seataste that\\nhad achieved the ladder and the picture its panelled front was in the\\nlikeness of a ships bluff bows and the holy bible rested on a\\nprojecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ships

condense starboard gangway there side away\\nto larboardlarboard gangway to starboard midships midships\\n\\nthere was a low rumbling of heavy seaboots among the benches and a\\nstill slighter shuffling of womens shoes and all was quiet again and\\nevery eye on the preacher\\n\\nhe paused a little then kneeling in the pulpits bows folded his\\nlarge brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and\\noffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying\\nat the bottom of the sea\\n\\nthis ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of a\\nbell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fogin such tones he\\ncommenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards\\nthe concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy\\n\\n\\n  the ribs and terrors in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom\\n  while all gods sunlit waves rolled by and lift me deepening down\\n  to doom\\n\\n  i saw the opening maw of hell with

swelled high above the\\nhowling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned\\nover the leaves of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon\\nthe proper page said beloved shipmates clinch the last verse of the\\nfirst chapter of jonahand god had prepared a great fish to swallow up\\njonah\\n\\nshipmates this book containing only four chaptersfour yarnsis one\\nof the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures yet what\\ndepths of the soul does jonahs deep sealine sound what a pregnant\\nlesson to us is this prophet what a noble thing is that canticle in\\nthe fishs belly how billowlike and boisterously grand we feel the\\nfloods surging over us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the\\nwaters seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us but _what_\\nis this lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it is a\\ntwostranded lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to\\nme as a pilot of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to us\\nall because it is a story of the sin hardheartedness suddenly\\nawakened fears the swift punishment repentance prayers and finally\\nthe deliverance and joy of jonah as with all sinners among men the\\nsin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the\\ncommand of godnever mind now what that command was or how\\nconveyedwhich he found a hard command but all the things that god\\nwould have us do are hard for us to doremember thatand hence he\\noftener commands us than endeavors to persuade and if we obey god we\\nmust disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein\\nthe hardness of obeying god consists\\n\\nwith this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts at\\ngod by seeking to flee from him he thinks that a ship made by men\\nwill carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the\\ncaptains of this earth he skulks about the wharves of joppa and seeks\\na ship thats bound for tarshish there lurks perhaps a hitherto\\nunheeded meaning here by all accounts tarshish could have been no\\nother city than the modern cadiz thats the opinion of learned men\\nand where is cadiz shipmates cadiz is in spain as far by water from\\njoppa as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when\\nthe atlantic was an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern\\njaffa shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean\\nthe syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the\\nwestward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye not\\nthen shipmates that jonah sought to flee worldwide from god\\nmiserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with\\nslouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the\\nshipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas so\\ndisordered selfcondemning is his look that had there been policemen\\nin those days jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had\\nbeen arrested ere he touched a deck how plainly hes a fugitive no\\nbaggage not a hatbox valise or carpetbagno friends accompany him\\nto the wharf with their adieux at last after much dodging search he\\nfinds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as\\nhe steps on board to see its captain in the cabin all the sailors for\\nthe moment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the strangers\\nevil eye jonah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and\\nconfidence in vain essays his wretched smile strong intuitions of the\\nman assure the mariners he can be no innocent in their gamesome but\\nstill serious way one whispers to the otherjack hes robbed a\\nwidow or joe do you mark him hes a bigamist or harry lad i\\nguess hes the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike\\none of the missing murderers from sodom another runs to read the bill\\nthats stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is\\nmoored offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a\\nparricide and containing a description of his person he reads and\\nlooks from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now\\ncrowd round jonah prepared to lay their hands upon him frighted jonah\\ntrembles and summoning all his boldness to his face only looks so\\nmuch the more a coward he will not confess himself suspected but that\\nitself is strong suspicion so he makes the best of it and when the\\nsailors find him not to be the man that is advertised they let him\\npass and he descends into the cabin\\n\\nwhos there cries the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making\\nout his papers for the customswhos there oh how that harmless\\nquestion mangles jonah for the instant he almost turns to flee again\\nbut he rallies i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon\\nsail ye sir thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah\\nthough the man now stands before him but no sooner does he hear that\\nhollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance we sail with the\\nnext coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing\\nhim no sooner sirsoon enough for any honest man that goes a\\npassenger ha jonah thats another stab but he swiftly calls away\\nthe captain from that scent ill sail with yehe saysthe passage\\nmoney how much is thatill pay now for it is particularly written\\nshipmates as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history\\nthat he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail and taken with\\nthe context this is full of meaning\\n\\nnow jonahs captain shipmates was one whose discernment detects\\ncrime in any but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless in\\nthis world shipmates sin that pays its way can travel freely and\\nwithout a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all\\nfrontiers so jonahs captain prepares to test the length of jonahs\\npurse ere he judge him openly he charges him thrice the usual sum\\nand its assented to then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive\\nbut at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with\\ngold yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions\\nstill molest the captain he rings every coin to find a counterfeit\\nnot a forger any way he mutters and jonah is put down for his\\npassage point out my stateroom sir says jonah now im\\ntravelweary i need sleep thou lookest like it says the captain\\ntheres thy room jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock\\ncontains no key hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captain\\nlaughs lowly to himself and mutters something about the doors of\\nconvicts cells being never allowed to be locked within all dressed\\nand dusty as he is jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the\\nlittle stateroom ceiling almost resting on his forehead the air is\\nclose and jonah gasps then in that contracted hole sunk too\\nbeneath the ships waterline jonah feels the heralding presentiment\\nof that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of\\nhis bowels wards\\n\\nscrewed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly\\noscillates in jonahs room and the ship heeling over towards the\\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame and\\nall though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity\\nwith reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight\\nitself it but made obvious the false lying levels among which it\\nhung the lamp alarms and frightens jonah as lying in his berth his\\ntormented eyes roll round the place and this thus far successful\\nfugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance but that\\ncontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him the floor the\\nceiling and the side are all awry oh so my conscience hangs in\\nme he groans straight upwards so it burns but the chambers of my\\nsoul are all in crookedness\\n\\nlike one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still\\nreeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of the\\nroman racehorse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him\\nas one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy\\nanguish praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at\\nlast amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as\\nover the man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and\\ntheres naught to staunch it so after sore wrestlings in his berth\\njonahs prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep\\n\\nand now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and\\nfrom the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening\\nglides to sea that ship my friends was the first of recorded\\nsmugglers the contraband was jonah but the sea rebels he will not\\nbear the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to\\nbreak but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her when\\nboxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind is\\nshrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunders with\\ntrampling feet right over jonahs head in all this raging tumult\\njonah sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging sea\\nfeels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far\\nrush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving\\nthe seas after him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides\\nof the shipa berth in the cabin as i have taken it and was fast\\nasleep but the frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead\\near what meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from his lethargy\\nby that direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the\\ndeck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he\\nis sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks wave\\nafter wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs\\nroaring fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet\\nafloat and ever as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the\\nsteep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees the rearing\\nbowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the\\ntormented deep\\n\\nterrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all his\\ncringing attitudes the godfugitive is now too plainly known the\\nsailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him\\nand at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to\\nhigh heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this\\ngreat tempest was upon them the lot is jonahs that discovered then\\nhow furiously they mob him with their questions what is thine\\noccupation whence comest thou thy country what people but mark now\\nmy shipmates the behavior of poor jonah the eager mariners but ask\\nhim who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer\\nto those questions but likewise another answer to a question not put\\nby them but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard\\nhand of god that is upon him\\n\\ni am a hebrew he criesand theni fear the lord the god of heaven\\nwho hath made the sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye well\\nmightest thou fear the lord god _then_ straightway he now goes on to\\nmake a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and more\\nappalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicating\\ngod for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his\\ndesertswhen wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him\\nforth into the sea for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest\\nwas upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means\\nto save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howls louder\\nthen with one hand raised invokingly to god with the other they not\\nunreluctantly lay hold of jonah\\n\\nand now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea\\nwhen instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the sea\\nis still as jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth water\\nbehind he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless\\ncommotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into\\nthe yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shootsto all his ivory\\nteeth like so many white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed\\nunto the lord out of the fishs belly but observe his prayer and\\nlearn a weighty lesson for sinful as he is jonah does not weep and\\nwail for direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is\\njust he leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with\\nthis that spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards\\nhis holy temple and here shipmates is true and faithful repentance\\nnot clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing\\nto god was this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance\\nof him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonah\\nbefore you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a\\nmodel for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it\\nlike jonah\\n\\nwhile he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking\\nslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who\\nwhen describing jonahs seastorm seemed tossed by a storm himself\\nhis deep chest heaved as with a groundswell his tossed arms seemed\\nthe warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away from\\noff his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his\\nsimple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them\\n\\nthere now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the\\nleaves of the book once more and at last standing motionless with\\nclosed eyes for the moment seemed communing with god and himself\\n\\nbut again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowly\\nwith an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake these\\nwords\\n\\nshipmates god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press\\nupon me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that\\njonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to\\nme for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come\\ndown from this masthead and sit on the hatches there where you sit\\nand listen as you listen while some one of you reads _me_ that other\\nand more awful lesson which jonah teaches to _me_ as a pilot of the\\nliving god how being an anointed pilotprophet or speaker of true\\nthings and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the\\nears of a wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should\\nraise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god\\nby taking ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never\\nreached as we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed\\nhim down to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him\\nalong into the midst of the seas where the eddying depths sucked him\\nten thousand fathoms down and the weeds were wrapped about his head\\nand all the watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyond\\nthe reach of any plummetout of the belly of hellwhen the whale\\ngrounded upon the oceans utmost bones even then god heard the\\nengulphed repenting prophet when he cried then god spake unto the\\nfish and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale\\ncame breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the\\ndelights of air and earth and vomited out jonah upon the dry land\\nwhen the word of the lord came a second time and jonah bruised and\\nbeatenhis ears like two seashells still multitudinously murmuring\\nof the oceanjonah did the almightys bidding and what was that\\nshipmates to preach the truth to the face of falsehood that was it\\n\\nthis shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of\\nthe living god who slights it woe to him whom this world charms from\\ngospel duty woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god\\nhas brewed them into a gale woe to him who seeks to please rather than\\nto appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woe\\nto him who in this world courts not dishonor woe to him who would\\nnot be true even though to be false were salvation yea woe to him\\nwho as the great pilot paul has it while preaching to others is\\nhimself a castaway\\n\\nhe dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his\\nface to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with\\na heavenly enthusiasmbut oh shipmates on the starboard hand of\\nevery woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight\\nthan the bottom of the woe is deep is not the maintruck higher than\\nthe kelson is low delight is to hima far far upward and inward\\ndelightwho against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever\\nstands forth his

his face with\\nhis hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed\\nand he was left alone in the place\\n\\n\\nchapter 10 a bosom friend\\n\\nreturning to the spouterinn from the chapel i found queequeg there\\nquite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction some\\ntime he was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet on the\\nstove hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his face that\\nlittle negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with a\\njackknife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to\\nhimself in his heathenish way\\n\\nbut being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going\\nto the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap\\nbegan counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth\\npageas i fanciedstopping a moment looking vacantly around him and\\ngiving utterance to a longdrawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he\\nwould then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number\\none each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was\\nonly by such a large number of fifties being found together that his\\nastonishment at the multitude of pages was excited\\n\\nwith much interest i sat watching him savage though he was and\\nhideously marred about the faceat least to my tastehis countenance\\nyet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable you\\ncannot hide the soul through all his unearthly tattooings i thought i\\nsaw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes\\nfiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a\\nthousand devils and besides all this there was a certain lofty\\nbearing about the pagan which even his uncouthness could not\\naltogether maim he looked like a man who had never cringed and never\\nhad had a creditor whether it was too that his head being shaved\\nhis forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief and looked\\nmore expansive than it otherwise would this i will not venture to\\ndecide but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent\\none it may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of general washingtons\\nhead as seen in the popular busts of him it had the same long\\nregularly graded retreating slope from above the brows which were\\nlikewise very projecting like two long promontories thickly wooded on\\ntop queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developed\\n\\nwhilst i was thus closely scanning him halfpretending meanwhile to be\\nlooking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my\\npresence never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but\\nappeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous\\nbook considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night\\nprevious and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found\\nthrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifference\\nof his very strange but savages are strange beings at times you do\\nnot know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing their\\ncalm selfcollectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i had\\nnoticed also that queequeg never consorted at all or but very little\\nwith the other seamen in the inn he made no advances whatever\\nappeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances\\nall this struck me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there\\nwas something almost sublime in it here was a man some twenty thousand\\nmiles from home by the way of cape horn that iswhich was the only\\nway he could get therethrown among people as strange to him as though\\nhe were in the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease\\npreserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionship\\nalways equal to himself surely this was a touch of fine philosophy\\nthough no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that but\\nperhaps to be true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of\\nso living or so striving so soon as i hear that such or such a man\\ngives himself out for a philosopher i conclude that like the\\ndyspeptic old woman he must have broken his digester\\n\\nas i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that\\nmild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then\\nonly glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering\\nround the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain the\\nstorm booming without in solemn swells i began to be sensible of\\nstrange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heart\\nand maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothing\\nsavage had redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a\\nnature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland\\ndeceits wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet i began to\\nfeel myself mysteriously drawn towards him and those same things that\\nwould have repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus\\ndrew me ill try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness\\nhas proved but hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made some\\nfriendly signs and hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile at\\nfirst he little noticed these advances but presently upon my\\nreferring to his last nights hospitalities he made out to ask me\\nwhether we were again to be bedfellows i told him yes whereat i\\nthought he looked pleased perhaps a little complimented\\n\\nwe then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain to\\nhim the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures\\nthat were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we\\nwent to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to\\nbe seen in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and\\nproducing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff and\\nthen we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping it\\nregularly passing between us\\n\\nif there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagans\\nbreast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and\\nleft us cronies he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and\\nunbiddenly as i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his\\nforehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that\\nhenceforth we were married meaning in his countrys phrase that we\\nwere bosom friends he would gladly die for me if need should be in a\\ncountryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too\\npremature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage\\nthose old rules would not apply\\n\\nafter supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room\\ntogether he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his\\nenormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some\\nthirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table and\\nmechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of them\\ntowards me and said it was mine i was going to remonstrate but he\\nsilenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pockets i let them stay\\nhe then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed\\nthe paper fireboard by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed\\nanxious for me to join him but well knowing what was to follow i\\ndeliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or\\notherwise\\n\\ni was a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\\npresbyterian church how then could i unite with this wild idolator in\\nworshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i do you\\nsuppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and\\nearthpagans and all includedcan possibly be jealous of an\\ninsignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worshipto do\\nthe will of god_that_ is worship and what is the will of godto do\\nto my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me_that_ is\\nthe will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish\\nthat this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular\\npresbyterian form of worship consequently i must then unite with him\\nin his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helped\\nprop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with\\nqueequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that\\ndone we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences\\nand all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat\\n\\nhow it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential\\ndisclosures between friends man and wife they say there open the\\nvery bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples often\\nlie and chat over old times till nearly morning thus then in our\\nhearts honeymoon lay i and queequega cosy loving pair\\n\\n\\nchapter 11 nightgown\\n\\nwe had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and\\nqueequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs\\nover mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free\\nand easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulations what\\nlittle nappishness remained in us altogether departed and we felt like\\ngetting up again though daybreak was yet some way down the future\\n\\nyes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position\\nbegan to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselves\\nsitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against the\\nheadboard with our four knees drawn up close together and our two\\nnoses bending over them as if our kneepans were warmingpans we felt\\nvery nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors\\nindeed out of bedclothes too seeing that there was no fire in the\\nroom the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some\\nsmall part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world\\nthat is not what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if\\nyou flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been\\nso a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more but\\nif like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown\\nof your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general\\nconsciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for\\nthis reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire\\nwhich is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the height\\nof this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket\\nbetween you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air then there\\nyou lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal\\n\\nwe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at\\nonce i thought i would open my eyes for when between sheets whether\\nby day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a way of always\\nkeeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness of\\nbeing in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright\\nexcept his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper\\nelement of our essences though light be more congenial to our clayey\\npart upon opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasant and\\nselfcreated darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the\\nunilluminated twelveoclockatnight i experienced a disagreeable\\nrevulsion nor did i at all object to the hint from queequeg that\\nperhaps it were best to strike a light seeing that we were so wide\\nawake and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs\\nfrom his tomahawk be it said that though i had felt such a strong\\nrepugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before yet see how\\nelastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them\\nfor now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me\\neven in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy\\nthen i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlords policy of\\ninsurance i was only alive to the condensed confidential\\ncomfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend\\nwith our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed the\\ntomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over us a blue\\nhanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flame of the newlit lamp\\n\\nwhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to\\nfar distant scenes i know not but he now spoke of his native island\\nand eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it he\\ngladly complied though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of\\nhis words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become more familiar\\nwith his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story\\nsuch as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give\\n\\n\\nchapter 12 biographical\\n\\nqueequeg was a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and\\nsouth it is not down in any map true places never are\\n\\nwhen a newhatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a\\ngrass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green\\nsapling even then in queequegs ambitious soul lurked a strong\\ndesire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or\\ntwo his father was a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and\\non the

all the king his fathers influence\\ncould prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddled\\noff to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when\\nshe quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on the other a\\nlow tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into\\nthe water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with\\nits prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and\\nwhen the ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her\\nside with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe\\nclimbed up the chains and throwing himself at full length upon the\\ndeck grappled a ringbolt there and swore not to let it go though\\nhacked in pieces\\n\\nin vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a\\ncutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king and\\nqueequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his\\nwild desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and\\ntold him he might make himself at home but this fine young savagethis\\nsea prince of wales never saw the captains cabin they put him down\\namong the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter\\ncontent to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained\\nno seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of\\nenlightening his untutored countrymen for at bottomso he told mehe\\nwas actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians the\\narts whereby to make his people still happier than they were and more\\nthan that still better than they were but alas the practices of\\nwhalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be both\\nmiserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his fathers\\nheathens arrived at last in old sag harbor and seeing what the\\nsailors did there and then going on to nantucket and seeing how they\\nspent their wages in _that_ place also poor queequeg gave it up for\\nlost thought he its a wicked world in all meridians ill die a\\npagan\\n\\nand thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christians\\nwore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer\\nways about him though now some time from home\\n\\nby hints i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having\\na coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he\\nbeing very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no not\\nyet and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians\\nhad unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty\\npagan kings before him but by and by he said he would returnas\\nsoon as he felt himself baptized again for the nonce however he\\nproposed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans they\\nhad made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a\\nsceptre now\\n\\ni asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future\\nmovements he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon\\nthis i told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my\\nintention to sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port\\nfor an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved to\\naccompany me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the\\nsame watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my\\nevery hap with both my hands in his boldly dip into the potluck of\\nboth worlds to all this i joyously assented for besides the affection\\ni now felt for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such\\ncould not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was\\nwholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted\\nwith the sea as known to merchant seamen\\n\\nhis story being ended with his pipes last dying puff queequeg\\nembraced me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the\\nlight we rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon\\nwere sleeping\\n\\n\\nchapter 13 wheelbarrow\\n\\nnext morning monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber\\nfor a block i settled my own and comrades bill using however my\\ncomrades money the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed\\namazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between\\nme and queequegespecially as peter coffins cock and bull stories\\nabout him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person\\nwhom i now companied with\\n\\nwe borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own\\npoor carpetbag and queequegs canvas sack and hammock away we went\\ndown to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the\\nwharf as we were going along the people stared not at queequeg so\\nmuchfor they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\\nstreetsbut at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms but we\\nheeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequeg\\nnow and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs i\\nasked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and\\nwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons to this in\\nsubstance he replied that though what i hinted was true enough yet\\nhe had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of\\nassured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate\\nwith the hearts of whales in short like many inland reapers and\\nmowers who go into the farmers meadows armed with their own\\nscythesthough in no wise obliged to furnish themeven so queequeg\\nfor his own private reasons preferred his own harpoon\\n\\nshifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about\\nthe first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was in sag harbor the\\nowners of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his\\nheavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about the\\nthingthough in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in\\nwhich to manage the barrowqueequeg puts his chest upon it lashes it\\nfast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf why\\nsaid i queequeg you might have known better than that one would\\nthink didnt the people laugh\\n\\nupon this he told me another story the people of his island of\\nrokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\\nof young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and\\nthis punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\\nmat where the feast is held now a certain grand merchant ship once\\ntouched at rokovoko and its commanderfrom all accounts a very\\nstately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captainthis\\ncommander was invited to the wedding feast of queequegs sister a\\npretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding\\nguests were assembled at the brides bamboo cottage this captain\\nmarches in and being assigned the post of honor placed himself over\\nagainst the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the\\nking queequegs father grace being saidfor those people have their\\ngrace as well as wethough queequeg told me that unlike us who at such\\ntimes look downwards to our platters they on the contrary copying\\nthe ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all feastsgrace i\\nsay being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial\\nceremony of the island that is dipping his consecrated and\\nconsecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage\\ncirculates seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the\\nceremony and thinking himselfbeing captain of a shipas having plain\\nprecedence over a mere island king especially in the kings own\\nhousethe captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the\\npunchbowltaking it i suppose for a huge fingerglass now said\\nqueequeg what you tink nowdidnt our people laugh\\n\\nat last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the\\nschooner hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet river on one\\nside new bedford rose in terraces of streets their icecovered trees\\nall glittering in the clear cold air huge hills and mountains of\\ncasks on casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the\\nworldwandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while\\nfrom others came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises\\nof fires and forges to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruises\\nwere on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only\\nbegins a second and a second ended only begins a third and so on\\nfor ever and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness\\nof all earthly effort\\n\\ngaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little\\nmoss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his\\nsnortings how i snuffed that tartar airhow i spurned that turnpike\\nearththat common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish\\nheels and hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea\\nwhich will permit no records\\n\\nat the same foamfountain queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me\\nhis dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed\\nteeth on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to\\nthe blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan\\nsideways leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a\\nwire the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes\\nso full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging\\nbowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of\\nthe passengers a lubberlike assembly who marvelled that two fellow\\nbeings should be so companionable as though a white man were anything\\nmore dignified than a whitewashed negro but there were some boobies\\nand bumpkins there who by their intense greenness must have come\\nfrom the heart and centre of all verdure queequeg caught one of these\\nyoung saplings mimicking him behind his back i thought the bumpkins\\nhour of doom was come dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caught\\nhim in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength\\nsent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern\\nin midsomerset the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet\\nwhile queequeg turning his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe\\nand passed it to me for a puff\\n\\ncapting capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer\\ncapting capting heres the devil\\n\\nhallo _you_ sir cried the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking\\nup to queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that dont you know\\nyou might have killed that chap\\n\\nwhat him say said queequeg as he mildly turned to me\\n\\nhe say said i that you came near kille that man there pointing\\nto the still shivering greenhorn\\n\\nkille cried queequeg twisting his tattooed face into an

more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye\\n\\nbut it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain to\\nmind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the mainsail had parted\\nthe weathersheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to\\nside completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poor\\nfellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all\\nhands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it\\nseemed madness it flew from right to left and back again almost in\\none ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of\\nsnapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capable\\nof being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing\\nthe boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the\\nmidst of this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and\\ncrawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured\\none end to the bulwarks and then flinging the other like a lasso\\ncaught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next\\njerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe the schooner was\\nrun into the wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern\\nboat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long\\nliving arc of a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimming\\nlike a dog throwing his long arms straight out before him and by\\nturns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam i\\nlooked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved\\nthe greenhorn had gone down shooting himself perpendicularly from the\\nwater queequeg now took an instants glance around him and seeming\\nto see just how matters were dived down and disappeared a few minutes\\nmore and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the other\\ndragging a lifeless form the boat soon picked them up the poor\\nbumpkin was restored all hands voted queequeg a noble trump the\\ncaptain begged his pardon from that hour i clove to queequeg like a\\nbarnacle yea till poor queequeg took his last long dive\\n\\nwas there ever such unconsciousness he did not seem to think that he\\nat all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies he\\nonly asked for waterfresh watersomething to wipe the brine off that\\ndone he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the\\nbulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying to\\nhimselfits a mutual jointstock world in all meridians we\\ncannibals must help these christians\\n\\n\\nchapter 14 nantucket\\n\\nnothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a\\nfine run we safely arrived in nantucket\\n\\nnantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of\\nthe world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely\\nthan the eddystone lighthouse look at ita mere hillock and elbow of\\nsand all beach without a background there is more sand there than\\nyou would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper some\\ngamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they\\ndont grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have\\nto send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that\\npieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true\\ncross in rome that people there plant toadstools before their houses\\nto get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass makes an\\noasis three blades in a days walk a prairie that they wear quicksand\\nshoes something like laplander snowshoes that they are so shut up\\nbelted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island\\nof by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams will\\nsometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles but these\\nextravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois\\n\\nlook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was\\nsettled by the redmen thus goes the legend in olden times an eagle\\nswooped down upon the new england coast and carried off an infant\\nindian in his talons with loud lament the parents saw their child\\nborne out of sight over the wide waters they resolved to follow in the\\nsame direction setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage\\nthey discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory\\ncasketthe poor little indians skeleton\\n\\nwhat wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should\\ntake to the sea for a livelihood they first caught crabs and quohogs\\nin the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets for mackerel more\\nexperienced they pushed off in boats and captured cod and at last\\nlaunching a navy of great ships on the sea explored this watery world\\nput an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in at\\nbehrings straits and in all seasons and all oceans declared\\neverlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the\\nflood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan saltsea\\nmastodon clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that\\nhis very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and\\nmalicious assaults\\n\\nand thus have these naked nantucketers these sea hermits issuing from\\ntheir anthill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like\\nso many alexanders parcelling out among them the atlantic pacific\\nand indian oceans as the three pirate powers did poland let america\\nadd mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english\\noverswarm all india and hang out their blazing banner from the sun\\ntwo thirds of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketers for the sea\\nis his he

business which a noahs flood\\nwould not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millions in china\\nhe lives on the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among\\nthe waves he climbs them as

landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to\\nsleep between billows so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight\\nof land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his\\nvery pillow rush herds of walruses and whales\\n\\n\\nchapter 15 chowder\\n\\nit was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to\\nanchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attend to no\\nbusiness that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlord\\nof the spouterinn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the\\ntry pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept\\nhotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assured us that cousin\\nhosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in short he\\nplainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try potluck\\nat the try pots but the directions he had given us about keeping a\\nyellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to\\nthe larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a\\ncorner three points to the starboard and that done then ask the first\\nman we met where the place was these crooked directions of his very\\nmuch puzzled us at first especially as at the outset queequeg\\ninsisted that the yellow warehouseour first point of departuremust be\\nleft on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to say\\nit was on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little in\\nthe dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to\\ninquire the way we at last came to something which there was no\\nmistaking\\n\\ntwo enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses ears\\nswung from the crosstrees of an old topmast planted in front of an\\nold doorway the horns of the crosstrees were sawed off on the other\\nside so that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows\\nperhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i\\ncould not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort\\nof crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns yes\\n_two_ of them one for queequeg and one for me its ominous thinks\\ni a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port\\ntombstones staring at me in the whalemens chapel and here a gallows\\nand a pair of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing out\\noblique hints touching tophet\\n\\ni was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\\nwith yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn\\nunder a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured\\neye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen\\nshirt\\n\\nget along with ye said she to the man or ill be combing ye\\n\\ncome on queequeg said i all right theres mrs hussey\\n\\nand so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving\\nmrs hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs upon\\nmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed mrs hussey\\npostponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a little\\nroom and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently\\nconcluded repast turned round to us and saidclam or cod\\n\\nwhats that about cods maam said i with much politeness\\n\\nclam or cod she repeated\\n\\na clam for supper a cold clam is _that_ what you mean mrs hussey\\nsays i but thats a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter\\ntime aint it mrs hussey\\n\\nbut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple\\nshirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing\\nbut the word clam mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leading\\nto the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared\\n\\nqueequeg said i do you think that we can make out a supper for us\\nboth on one clam\\n\\nhowever a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\\napparently cheerless prospect before us but when that smoking chowder\\ncame in the mystery was delightfully explained oh sweet friends\\nhearken to me it was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than\\nhazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up\\ninto little flakes the whole enriched with butter and plentifully\\nseasoned with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by the\\nfrosty voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing\\nfood before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we\\ndespatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and\\nbethinking me of mrs husseys clam and cod announcement i thought i\\nwould try a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i uttered\\nthe word cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat in a few\\nmoments the savoury steam came forth again but with a different\\nflavor and in good time a fine codchowder was placed before us\\n\\nwe resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks i\\nto myself i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head whats\\nthat stultifying saying about chowderheaded people but look\\nqueequeg aint that a live eel in your bowl wheres your harpoon\\n\\nfishiest of all fishy places was the try pots which well deserved its\\nname for the pots there were always boiling chowders chowder for\\nbreakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you\\nbegan to look for fishbones coming through your clothes the area\\nbefore the house was paved with clamshells mrs hussey wore a\\npolished necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his account\\nbooks bound in superior old sharkskin there was a fishy flavor to the\\nmilk too which i could not at all account for till one morning\\nhappening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermens\\nboats i saw hoseas brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and\\nmarching along the sand with each foot in a cods decapitated head\\nlooking very slipshod i assure ye\\n\\nsupper concluded we received a lamp and directions from mrs hussey\\nconcerning the nearest way to bed but as queequeg was about to\\nprecede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demanded\\nhis harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers why not said i\\nevery true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonbut why not because\\nits dangerous says she ever since young stiggs coming from that\\nunfortnt vyge of his when he was gone four years and a half with\\nonly three barrels of _ile_ was found dead in my first floor back\\nwith his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarders to\\ntake sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night so mr queequeg\\nfor she had learned his name i will just take this here iron and\\nkeep it for you till morning but the chowder clam or cod tomorrow\\nfor breakfast men\\n\\nboth says i and lets have a couple of smoked herring by way of\\nvariety\\n\\n\\nchapter 16 the ship\\n\\nin bed we concocted our plans for the morrow but to my surprise and no\\nsmall concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been\\ndiligently consulting yojothe name of his black little godand yojo\\nhad told him two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it\\neveryway that instead of our going together among the whalingfleet in\\nharbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i say\\nyojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest\\nwholly with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in order\\nto do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself\\ni ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though\\nit had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship\\nmyself for the present irrespective of queequeg\\n\\ni have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placed great\\nconfidence in the excellence of yojos judgment and surprising forecast\\nof things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a rather\\ngood sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in\\nall cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs\\n\\nnow this plan of queequegs or rather yojos touching the selection\\nof our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a little\\nrelied upon queequegs sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to\\ncarry us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrances\\nproduced no effect upon queequeg i was obliged to acquiesce and\\naccordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined\\nrushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that\\ntrifling little affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up\\nwith yojo in our little bedroomfor it seemed that it was some sort of\\nlent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with\\nqueequeg and yojo that day _how_ it was i never could find out for\\nthough i applied myself to it several times i never could master his\\nliturgies and xxxix articlesleaving queequeg then fasting on his\\ntomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of\\nshavings i sallied out among the shipping after much prolonged\\nsauntering and many random inquiries i learnt that there were three\\nships up for threeyears voyagesthe devildam the titbit and the\\npequod _devildam_ i do not know the origin of _titbit_ is obvious\\n_pequod_ you will no doubt remember was the name of a celebrated\\ntribe of massachusetts indians now extinct as the ancient medes i\\npeered and pryed about the devildam from her hopped over to the\\ntitbit and finally going on board the pequod looked around her for\\na moment and then decided that this was the very ship for us\\n\\nyou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i\\nknowsquaretoed luggers mountainous japanese junks butterbox\\ngalliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a\\nrare old craft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the old\\nschool rather small if anything with an oldfashioned clawfooted\\nlook about her long seasoned and weatherstained in the typhoons and\\ncalms of all four oceans her old hulls complexion was darkened like a\\nfrench grenadiers who has alike fought in egypt and siberia her\\nvenerable bows looked bearded her mastscut somewhere on the coast of\\njapan where her original ones were lost overboard in a galeher masts\\nstood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne her\\nancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrimworshipped\\nflagstone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all these\\nher old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining\\nto the wild business that for more than half a century she had\\nfollowed old captain peleg many years her chiefmate before he\\ncommanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one\\nof the principal owners of the pequodthis old peleg during the term\\nof his chiefmateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and\\ninlaid it all over with a quaintness both of material and device\\nunmatched by anything except it be thorkillhakes carved buckler or\\nbedstead she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his\\nneck heavy with pendants of polished ivory she was a thing of\\ntrophies a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in the chased\\nbones of her enemies all round her unpanelled open bulwarks were\\ngarnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the\\nsperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her old hempen thews\\nand tendons to those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood\\nbut deftly travelled over sheaves of seaivory scorning a turnstile\\nwheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller\\nwas in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her\\nhereditary foe the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest\\nfelt like the tartar when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching\\nits jaw a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy all noble things\\nare touched with that\\n\\nnow when i looked about the quarterdeck for some one having\\nauthority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at\\nfirst i saw nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of\\ntent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the mainmast it\\nseemed only a temporary erection used in port it was of a conical\\nshape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber\\nblack bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the\\nrightwhale planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of\\nthese slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at\\nthe apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres waved\\nto and fro like the topknot on some old pottowottamie sachems head a\\ntriangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that the\\ninsider commanded a complete view forward\\n\\nand half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who by\\nhis aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and the\\nships work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of\\ncommand he was seated on an oldfashioned oaken chair wriggling all\\nover with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a\\nstout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\\nconstructed\\n\\nthere was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of\\nthe elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen\\nand heavily rolled up in blue pilotcloth cut in the quaker style\\nonly there was a fine and almost microscopic network of the minutest\\nwrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from his\\ncontinual sailings in many hard gales and always looking to\\nwindwardfor this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed\\ntogether such eyewrinkles are very effectual in a scowl\\n\\nis this the captain of the pequod said i advancing to the door of\\nthe tent\\n\\nsupposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of\\nhim he demanded\\n\\ni was thinking of shipping\\n\\nthou wast wast thou i see thou art no nantucketerever been in a\\nstove boat\\n\\nno sir i never have\\n\\ndost know nothing at all about whaling i dare sayeh\\n\\nnothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn ive been\\nseveral voyages in the merchant service and i think that\\n\\nmerchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see that\\nlegill take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of\\nthe marchant service to me again marchant service indeed i suppose\\nnow ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant\\nships but flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling ehit\\nlooks a little suspicious dont it ehhast not been a pirate hast\\nthoudidst not rob thy last captain didst thoudost not think of\\nmurdering the officers when thou gettest to sea\\n\\ni protested my innocence of these things i saw that under the mask of\\nthese half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulated\\nquakerish nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and rather\\ndistrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the\\nvineyard\\n\\nbut what takes thee awhaling i want to know that before i think of\\nshipping ye\\n\\nwell sir i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world\\n\\nwant to see what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab\\n\\nwho is captain ahab sir\\n\\naye aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship\\n\\ni am mistaken then i thought i was speaking to the captain himself\\n\\nthou art speaking to captain pelegthats who ye are speaking to\\nyoung man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted\\nout for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew we\\nare part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantest\\nto know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a way\\nof finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clap\\neye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only one\\nleg\\n\\nwhat do you mean sir was the other one lost by a whale\\n\\nlost by a whale young man come nearer to me it was devoured chewed\\nup crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a\\nboatah ah\\n\\ni was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at\\nthe hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as i\\ncould what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know\\nthere was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed\\ni might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident\\n\\nlook ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft dye see thou\\ndost not talk shark a bit _sure_ yeve been to sea before now sure\\nof that\\n\\nsir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyages in\\nthe merchant\\n\\nhard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant\\nservicedont aggravate mei wont have it but let us understand each\\nother i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel\\ninclined for it\\n\\ni do sir\\n\\nvery good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live\\nwhales throat and then jump after it answer quick\\n\\ni am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to\\nbe got rid of that is which i dont take to be the fact\\n\\ngood again now then thou not only wantest to go awhaling to find\\nout by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to\\nsee the world was not that what ye said i thought so well then just\\nstep forward there and take a peep over the weatherbow and then back\\nto me and tell me what ye see there\\n\\nfor a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not\\nknowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest but\\nconcentrating all his crows feet into one scowl captain peleg started\\nme on the errand\\n\\ngoing forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that the\\nship swinging to her anchor with the floodtide was now obliquely\\npointing towards the open ocean the prospect was unlimited but\\nexceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i\\ncould see\\n\\nwell whats the report said peleg when i came back what did ye\\nsee\\n\\nnot much i repliednothing but water considerable horizon though\\nand theres a squall coming up i think\\n\\nwell what does thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish to go\\nround cape horn to see any more of it eh cant ye see the world where\\nyou stand\\n\\ni was a little staggered but go awhaling i must and i would and the\\npequod was as good a ship as anyi thought the bestand all this i now\\nrepeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his\\nwillingness to ship me\\n\\nand thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he addedcome\\nalong with ye and so saying he led the way below deck into the\\ncabin\\n\\nseated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\\nsurprising figure it turned out to be captain bildad who along with\\ncaptain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other\\nshares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd\\nof old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards\\neach owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a\\nnail or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in\\nwhaling vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state\\nstocks bringing in good interest\\n\\nnow bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was a\\nquaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to\\nthis day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the\\npeculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified by\\nthings altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same\\nquakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whalehunters they\\nare fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance\\n\\nso that there are instances among them of men who named with\\nscripture namesa singularly common fashion on the islandand in\\nchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the\\nquaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless\\nadventure of their subsequent lives strangely blend with these\\nunoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not\\nunworthy a scandinavian seaking or a poetical pagan roman and when\\nthese things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a\\nglobular brain and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillness and\\nseclusion of many long nightwatches in the remotest waters and\\nbeneath constellations never seen here at the north been led to think\\nuntraditionally and independently receiving all natures sweet or\\nsavage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\\nbreast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental\\nadvantages to learn a bold and nervous lofty languagethat man makes\\none in a whole nations censusa mighty pageant creature formed for\\nnoble tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramatically\\nregarded if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seems\\na half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature for\\nall men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness be\\nsure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease\\nbut as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another\\nand still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from\\nanother phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstances\\n\\nlike captain peleg captain bildad was a welltodo retired whaleman\\nbut unlike captain pelegwho cared not a rush for what are called\\nserious things and indeed deemed those selfsame serious things the\\nveriest of all triflescaptain bildad had not only been originally\\neducated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but\\nall his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely\\nisland creatures round the hornall that had not moved this native\\nborn quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of his\\nvest still for all this immutableness was there some lack of common\\nconsistency about worthy captain bildad though refusing from\\nconscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself\\nhad illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn\\nfoe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straightbodied coat spilled\\ntuns upon tuns of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening\\nof his days the pious bildad reconciled these things in the\\nreminiscence i do not know but it did not seem to concern him much\\nand very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible\\nconclusion that a mans religion is one thing and this practical world\\nquite another this world pays dividends rising from a little\\ncabinboy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a\\nbroad shadbellied waistcoat from that becoming boatheader\\nchiefmate and captain and finally a ship owner bildad as i hinted\\nbefore had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from\\nactive life at the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining\\ndays to the quiet receiving of his wellearned income\\n\\nnow bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of being an\\nincorrigible old hunks and in his seagoing days a bitter hard\\ntaskmaster they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a\\ncurious story that when he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew\\nupon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital\\nsore exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for a quaker\\nhe was certainly rather hardhearted to say the least he never used\\nto swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an\\ninordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when\\nbildad was a chiefmate to have his drabcoloured eye intently looking\\nat you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch\\nsomethinga hammer or a marlingspike and go to work like mad at\\nsomething or other never mind what indolence and idleness perished\\nbefore him his own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian\\ncharacter on his long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no\\nsuperfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it like\\nthe worn nap of his broadbrimmed hat\\n\\nsuch then was the person that i saw seated on the transom when i\\nfollowed captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the decks\\nwas small and there boltupright sat old bildad who always sat so\\nand never leaned and this to save his coat tails his broadbrim was\\nplaced beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture was\\nbuttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in\\nreading from a ponderous volume\\n\\nbildad cried captain peleg at it again bildad eh ye have been\\nstudying those scriptures now for the last thirty years to my\\ncertain knowledge how far ye got bildad\\n\\nas if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate\\nbildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up\\nand seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg\\n\\nhe says hes our man bildad said peleg he wants to ship\\n\\ndost thee said bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me\\n\\ni _dost_ said i unconsciously he was so intense a quaker\\n\\nwhat do ye think of him bildad said peleg\\n\\nhell do said bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away at\\nhis book in a mumbling tone quite audible\\n\\ni thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially as peleg\\nhis friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said\\nnothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw open a chest\\nand drawing forth the ships articles placed pen and ink before him\\nand seated himself at a little table i began to think it was high time\\nto settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for\\nthe voyage i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid\\nno wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares\\nof the profits called _lays_ and that these lays were proportioned to\\nthe degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the\\nships company i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my\\nown lay would not be very large but considering that i was used to the\\nsea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt\\nthat from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275th\\nlaythat is the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage\\nwhatever that might eventually amount to and though the 275th lay was\\nwhat they call a rather _long lay_ yet it was better than nothing and\\nif we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i\\nwould wear out on it not to speak of my three years beef and board\\nfor which i would not have to pay one stiver\\n\\nit might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\\nfortuneand so it was a very poor way indeed but i am one of those\\nthat never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the\\nworld is ready to board and lodge me while i am putting up at this\\ngrim sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the\\n275th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been\\nsurprised had i been offered the 200th considering i was of a\\nbroadshouldered make\\n\\nbut one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful about\\nreceiving a generous share of the profits was this ashore i had heard\\nsomething of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad\\nhow that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod therefore\\nthe other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners left nearly the\\nwhole management of the ships affairs to these two and i did not know\\nbut what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about\\nshipping hands especially as i now found him on board the pequod\\nquite at home there in the cabin and reading his bible as if at his\\nown fireside now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\\njackknife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that he\\nwas such an interested party in these proceedings bildad never heeded\\nus but went on mumbling to himself out of his book _lay_ not up for\\nyourselves treasures upon earth where moth\\n\\nwell captain bildad interrupted peleg what dye say what lay\\nshall we give this young man\\n\\nthou knowest best was the sepulchral reply the seven hundred and\\nseventyseventh wouldnt be too much would itwhere moth and rust do\\ncorrupt but _lay_\\n\\n_lay_ indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred and\\nseventyseventh well old bildad you are determined that i for one\\nshall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below where moth and rust do\\ncorrupt it was an exceedingly _long lay_ that indeed and though from\\nthe magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yet\\nthe slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\\nseventyseven is a pretty large number yet when you come to make a\\n_teenth_ of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred and\\nseventyseventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven\\nhundred and seventyseven gold doubloons and so i thought at the time\\n\\nwhy blast your eyes bildad cried peleg thou dost not want to\\nswindle this young man he must have more than that\\n\\nseven hundred and seventyseventh again said bildad without lifting\\nhis eyes and then went on mumblingfor where your treasure is there\\nwill your heart be also\\n\\ni am going to put him down for the three hundredth said peleg do\\nye hear that bildad the three hundredth lay i say\\n\\nbildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said\\ncaptain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the\\nduty thou owest to the other owners of this shipwidows and orphans\\nmany of themand that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this\\nyoung man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those\\norphans the seven hundred and seventyseventh lay captain peleg\\n\\nthou bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about the\\ncabin blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these\\nmatters i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be\\nheavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape\\nhorn\\n\\ncaptain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing\\nten inches of water or ten fathoms i cant tell but as thou art\\nstill an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy\\nconscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering\\ndown to the fiery pit captain peleg\\n\\nfiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye\\ninsult me its an allfired outrage to tell any human creature that\\nhes bound to hell flukes and flames bildad say that again to me\\nand start my soulbolts but illillyes ill swallow a live goat\\nwith all his hair and horns on out of the cabin ye canting\\ndrabcoloured son of a wooden guna straight wake with ye\\n\\nas he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad but with a\\nmarvellous oblique sliding celerity bildad for that time eluded him\\n\\nalarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\\nresponsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all\\nidea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\\ncommanded i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad who\\ni made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened\\nwrath of peleg but to my astonishment he sat down again on the\\ntransom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\\nwithdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways as\\nfor peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemed no more\\nleft in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a\\nlittle as if still nervously agitated whew he whistled at lastthe\\nsqualls gone off to leeward i think bildad thou used to be good at\\nsharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jackknife here needs\\nthe grindstone thats he thank ye bildad now then my young man\\nishmaels thy name didnt ye say well then down ye go here ishmael\\nfor the three hundredth lay\\n\\ncaptain peleg said i i have a friend with me who wants to ship\\ntooshall i bring him down tomorrow\\n\\nto be sure said peleg fetch him along and well look at him\\n\\nwhat lay does he want groaned bildad glancing up from the book in\\nwhich he had again been burying himself\\n\\noh never thee mind about that bildad said peleg has he ever\\nwhaled it any turning to me\\n\\nkilled more whales than i can count captain peleg\\n\\nwell bring him along then\\n\\nand after signing the papers off i went nothing doubting but that i\\nhad done a good mornings work and that the pequod was the identical\\nship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape\\n\\nbut i had not proceeded far when i began to bethink me that the\\ncaptain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me though\\nindeed in many cases a whaleship will be completely fitted out and\\nreceive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible by\\narriving to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged\\nand the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the\\ncaptain have a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort he\\ndoes not trouble himself much about his ship in port but leaves her to\\nthe owners till all is ready for sea however it is always as well to\\nhave a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his\\nhands turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain\\nahab was to be found\\n\\nand what dost thou want of captain ahab its all right enough thou\\nart shipped\\n\\nyes but i should like to see him\\n\\nbut i dont think thou wilt be able to at present i dont know\\nexactly whats the matter with him but he keeps close inside the\\nhouse a sort of sick and yet he dont look so in fact he aint\\nsick but no he isnt well either any how young man he wont always\\nsee me so i dont suppose he will thee hes a queer man captain\\nahabso some thinkbut a good one oh thoult like him well enough no\\nfear no fear hes a grand ungodly godlike man captain ahab\\ndoesnt speak much but when he does speak then you may well listen\\nmark ye be forewarned ahabs above the common ahabs been in\\ncolleges as well as mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders\\nthan the waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than\\nwhales his lance aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our\\nisle oh he aint captain bildad no and he aint captain peleg\\n_hes ahab_ boy and ahab of old thou knowest was a crowned king\\n\\nand a very vile one when that wicked king was slain the dogs did\\nthey not lick his blood\\n\\ncome hither to mehither hither said peleg with a significance in\\nhis eye that almost startled me look ye lad never say that on board\\nthe pequod never say it anywhere captain ahab did not name himself\\ntwas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died\\nwhen he was only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at\\ngayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and\\nperhaps other fools like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn\\nthee its a lie i know captain ahab well ive sailed with him as\\nmate years ago i know what he isa good mannot a pious good man\\nlike bildad but a swearing good mansomething like meonly theres a\\ngood deal more of him aye aye i know that he was never very jolly\\nand i know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind\\nfor a spell but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump\\nthat brought that about as any one might see i know too that ever\\nsince he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale hes been a\\nkind of moodydesperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all\\npass off and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young\\nman its better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\\none so goodbye to theeand wrong not captain ahab because he happens\\nto have a wicked name besides my boy he has a wifenot three voyages\\nweddeda sweet resigned girl think of that by that sweet girl that\\nold man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm\\nin ahab no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab has his\\nhumanities\\n\\nas i walked away i was full of thoughtfulness what had been\\nincidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me with a certain\\nwild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the time\\ni felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i dont know what\\nunless it was the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange\\nawe of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe was\\nnot exactly awe i do not know what it was but i felt it and it did\\nnot disincline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed\\nlike mystery in him so imperfectly as he was known to me then\\nhowever my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so\\nthat for the present dark ahab slipped my mind\\n\\n\\nchapter 17 the ramadan\\n\\nas queequegs ramadan or fasting and humiliation was to continue all\\nday i did not choose to disturb him till towards nightfall for i\\ncherish the greatest respect towards everybodys religious obligations\\nnever mind how comical and could not find it in my heart to undervalue\\neven a congregation of ants worshipping a toadstool or those other\\ncreatures in certain parts of our earth who with a degree of\\nfootmanism quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before the\\ntorso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the\\ninordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name\\n\\ni say we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these\\nthings and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals\\npagans and what not because of their halfcrazy conceits on these\\nsubjects there was queequeg now certainly entertaining the most\\nabsurd notions about yojo and his ramadanbut what of that queequeg\\nthought he knew what he was about i suppose he seemed to be content\\nand there let him rest all our arguing with him would not avail let\\nhim be i say and heaven have mercy on us allpresbyterians and pagans\\nalikefor we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and\\nsadly need mending\\n\\ntowards evening when i felt assured that all his performances and\\nrituals must be over i went up to his room and knocked at the door\\nbut no answer i tried to open it but it was fastened inside\\nqueequeg said i softly through the keyholeall silent i say\\nqueequeg why dont you speak its iishmael but all remained still\\nas before i began to grow alarmed i had allowed him such abundant\\ntime i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit i looked through\\nthe keyhole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room the\\nkeyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one i could only see\\npart of the footboard of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing\\nmore i was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden\\nshaft of queequegs harpoon which the landlady the evening previous\\nhad taken from him before our mounting to the chamber thats strange\\nthought i but at any rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he\\nseldom or never goes abroad without it therefore he must be inside\\nhere and no possible mistake\\n\\nqueequegqueequegall still something must have happened\\napoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted\\nrunning down stairs i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person\\ni metthe chambermaid la la she cried i thought something must\\nbe the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door was\\nlocked and not a mouse to be heard and its been just so silent ever\\nsince but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked your\\nbaggage in for safe keeping la la maammistress murder mrs\\nhussey apoplexyand with these cries she ran towards the kitchen i\\nfollowing\\n\\nmrs hussey soon appeared with a mustardpot in one hand and a\\nvinegarcruet in the other having just broken away from the occupation\\nof attending to the castors and scolding her little black boy\\nmeantime\\n\\nwoodhouse cried i which way to it run for gods sake and fetch\\nsomething to pry open the doorthe axethe axe hes had a stroke\\ndepend upon itand so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairs\\nagain emptyhanded when mrs hussey interposed the mustardpot and\\nvinegarcruet and the entire castor of her countenance\\n\\nwhats the matter with you young man\\n\\nget the axe for gods sake run for the doctor some one while i pry\\nit open\\n\\nlook here said the landlady quickly putting down the vinegarcruet\\nso as to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying\\nopen any of my doorsand with that she seized my arm whats the\\nmatter with you whats the matter with you shipmate\\n\\nin as calm but rapid a manner as possible i gave her to understand\\nthe whole case unconsciously clapping the vinegarcruet to one side of\\nher nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimedno i havent\\nseen it since i put it there running to a little closet under the\\nlanding of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me that\\nqueequegs harpoon was missing hes killed himself she cried its\\nunfortnate stiggs done over againthere goes another counterpanegod\\npity his poor motherit will be the ruin of my house has the poor lad\\na sister wheres that girlthere betty go to snarles the painter\\nand tell him to paint me a sign withno suicides permitted here and\\nno smoking in the parlormight as well kill both birds at once kill\\nthe lord be merciful to his ghost whats that noise there you young\\nman avast there\\n\\nand running up after me she caught me as i was again trying to force\\nopen the door\\n\\ni dont allow it i wont have my premises spoiled go for the\\nlocksmith theres one about a mile from here but avast putting her\\nhand in her sidepocket heres a key thatll fit i guess lets\\nsee and with that she turned it in the lock but alas queequegs\\nsupplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within\\n\\nhave to burst it open said i and was running down the entry a\\nlittle for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing\\ni should not break down her premises but i tore from her and with a\\nsudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark\\n\\nwith a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slamming\\nagainst the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good\\nheavens there sat queequeg altogether cool and selfcollected right\\nin the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo on\\ntop of his head he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat\\nlike a carved image with scarce a sign of active life\\n\\nqueequeg said i going up to him queequeg whats the matter with\\nyou\\n\\nhe haint been a sittin so all day has he said the landlady\\n\\nbut all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt\\nlike pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost\\nintolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained\\nespecially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of\\neight or ten hours going too without his regular meals\\n\\nmrs hussey said i hes _alive_ at all events so leave us if you\\nplease and i will see to this strange affair myself\\n\\nclosing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to prevail upon\\nqueequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all he could\\ndofor all my polite arts and blandishmentshe would not move a peg\\nnor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in\\nthe slightest way\\n\\ni wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do\\nthey fast on their hams that way in his native island it must be so\\nyes its part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest hell\\nget up sooner or later no doubt it cant last for ever thank god\\nand his ramadan only comes once a year and i dont believe its very\\npunctual then\\n\\ni went down to supper after sitting a long time listening to the long\\nstories of some sailors who had just come from a plumpudding voyage\\nas they called it that is a short whalingvoyage in a schooner or\\nbrig confined to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only\\nafter listening to these plumpuddingers till nearly eleven oclock i\\nwent up stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequeg\\nmust certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination but no there\\nhe was just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch i began\\nto grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to\\nbe sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room\\nholding a piece of wood on his head\\n\\nfor heavens sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and\\nhave some supper youll starve youll kill yourself queequeg but\\nnot a word did he reply\\n\\ndespairing of him therefore i determined to go to bed and to sleep\\nand no doubt before a great while he would follow me but previous to\\nturning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as\\nit promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his\\nordinary round jacket on for some time do all i would i could not\\nget into the faintest doze i had blown out the candle and the mere\\nthought of queequegnot four feet offsitting there in that uneasy\\nposition stark alone in the cold and dark this made me really\\nwretched think of it sleeping all night in the same room with a wide\\nawake pagan on his hams in this dreary unaccountable ramadan\\n\\nbut somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till break of\\nday when looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg as if he\\nhad been screwed down to the floor but as soon as the first glimpse of\\nsun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints but\\nwith a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed his\\nforehead again against mine and said his ramadan was over\\n\\nnow as i before hinted i have no objection to any persons religion\\nbe it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insult any\\nother person because that other person dont believe it also but when\\na mans religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment\\nto him and in fine makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to\\nlodge in then i think it high time to take that individual aside and\\nargue the point with him\\n\\nand just so i now did with queequeg queequeg said i get into bed\\nnow and lie and listen to me i then went on beginning with the rise\\nand progress of the primitive religions and coming down to the various\\nreligions of the present time during which time i labored to show\\nqueequeg that all these lents ramadans and prolonged hamsquattings\\nin cold cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health\\nuseless for the soul opposed in short to the obvious laws of hygiene\\nand common sense i told him too that he being in other things such\\nan extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly\\npained me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous\\nramadan of his besides argued i fasting makes the body cave in\\nhence the spirit caves in and all thoughts born of a fast must\\nnecessarily be halfstarved this is the reason why most dyspeptic\\nreligionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters in\\none word queequeg said i rather digressively hell is an idea first\\nborn on an undigested appledumpling and since then perpetuated\\nthrough the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans\\n\\ni then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\\ndyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it\\nin he said no only upon one memorable occasion it was after a great\\nfeast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle\\nwherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two oclock in the\\nafternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening\\n\\nno more queequeg said i shuddering that will do for i knew the\\ninferences without his further hinting them i had seen a sailor who\\nhad visited that very island and he told me that it was the custom\\nwhen a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain in\\nthe yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they were\\nplaced in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a pilau\\nwith breadfruit and cocoanuts and with some parsley in their mouths\\nwere sent round with the victors compliments to all his friends just\\nas though these presents were so many christmas turkeys\\n\\nafter all i do not think that my remarks about religion made much\\nimpression upon queequeg because in the first place he somehow\\nseemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered\\nfrom his own point of view and in the second place he did not more\\nthan one third understand me couch my ideas simply as i would and\\nfinally he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\\nreligion than i did he looked at me with a sort of condescending\\nconcern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity that such\\na sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan\\npiety\\n\\nat last we rose and dressed and queequeg taking a prodigiously hearty\\nbreakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landlady should not\\nmake much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the\\npequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bones\\n\\n\\nchapter 18 his mark\\n\\nas we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg\\ncarrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us\\nfrom his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal\\nand furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that\\ncraft unless they previously produced their papers\\n\\nwhat do you mean by that captain peleg said i now jumping on the\\nbulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf\\n\\ni mean he replied he must show his papers\\n\\nyes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from\\nbehind pelegs out of the wigwam he must show that hes converted\\nson of darkness he added turning to queequeg art thou at present\\nin communion with any christian church\\n\\nwhy said i hes a member of the first congregational church here\\nbe it said that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at\\nlast come to be converted into the churches\\n\\nfirst congregational church cried bildad what that worships in\\ndeacon deuteronomy colemans meetinghouse and so saying taking out\\nhis spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana\\nhandkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the\\nwigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long look at\\nqueequeg\\n\\nhow long hath he been a member he then said turning to me not\\nvery long i rather guess young man\\n\\nno said peleg and he hasnt been baptized right either or it\\nwould have washed some of that devils blue off his face\\n\\ndo tell now cried bildad is this philistine a regular member of\\ndeacon deuteronomys meeting i never saw him going there and i pass\\nit every lords day\\n\\ni dont know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting said\\ni all i know is that queequeg here is a born member of the first\\ncongregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is\\n\\nyoung man said bildad sternly thou art skylarking with meexplain\\nthyself thou young hittite what church dost thee mean answer me\\n\\nfinding myself thus hard pushed i replied i mean sir the same\\nancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there\\nand queequeg here and all of us and every mothers son and soul of us\\nbelong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole\\nworshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some\\nqueer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in _that_ we all\\njoin hands\\n\\nsplice thou meanst _splice_ hands cried peleg drawing nearer\\nyoung man youd better ship for a missionary instead of a foremast\\nhand i never heard a better sermon deacon deuteronomywhy father\\nmapple himself couldnt beat it and hes reckoned something come\\naboard come aboard never mind about the papers i say tell quohog\\ntherewhats that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great\\nanchor what a harpoon hes got there looks like good stuff that and\\nhe handles it about right i say quohog or whatever your name is did\\nyou ever stand in the head of a whaleboat did you ever strike a\\nfish\\n\\nwithout saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon\\nthe bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboats\\nhanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his\\nharpoon cried out in some such way as this\\n\\ncapain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him well\\nspose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he\\ndarted the iron right over old bildads broad brim clean across the\\nships decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight\\n\\nnow said queequeg quietly hauling in the line sposee him whalee\\neye why dad whale dead\\n\\nquick bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close\\nvicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin\\ngangway quick i say you bildad and get the ships papers we must\\nhave hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boats look ye\\nquohog well give ye the ninetieth lay and thats more than ever was\\ngiven a harpooneer yet out of nantucket\\n\\nso down we went into the cabin and to my great joy queequeg was soon\\nenrolled among the same ships company to which i myself belonged\\n\\nwhen all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for\\nsigning he turned to me and said i guess quohog there dont know\\nhow to write does he i say quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy name\\nor make thy mark\\n\\nbut at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken\\npart in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but taking the\\noffered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact\\ncounterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm so\\nthat through captain pelegs obstinate mistake touching his\\nappellative it stood something like this\\n\\nquohog his x mark\\n\\nmeanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg\\nand at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his\\nbroadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts and selecting one\\nentitled the latter day coming or no time to lose placed it in\\nqueequegs hands and then grasping them and the book with both his\\nlooked earnestly into his eyes and said son of darkness i must do\\nmy duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for\\nthe souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways\\nwhich i sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial\\nbondsman spurn the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the\\nwrath to come mind thine eye i say oh goodness gracious steer\\nclear of the fiery pit\\n\\nsomething of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildads language\\nheterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases\\n\\navast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer\\ncried peleg pious harpooneers never make good voyagersit takes the\\nshark out of em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty\\nsharkish there was young nat swaine once the bravest boatheader out\\nof all nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting and never\\ncame to good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he\\nshrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of afterclaps in case\\nhe got stove and went to davy jones\\n\\npeleg peleg said bildad lifting his eyes and hands thou thyself\\nas i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what\\nit is to have the fear of death how then canst thou prate in this\\nungodly guise thou beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this\\nsame pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on\\njapan that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab didst\\nthou not think of death and the judgment then\\n\\nhear him hear him now cried peleg marching across the cabin and\\nthrusting his hands far down into his pocketshear him all of ye\\nthink of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink death\\nand the judgment then what with all three masts making such an\\neverlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over\\nus fore and aft think of death and the judgment then no no time to\\nthink about death then life was what captain ahab and i was thinking\\nof and how to save all handshow to rig jurymastshow to get into the\\nnearest port that was what i was thinking of\\n\\nbildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where\\nwe followed him there he stood very quietly overlooking some\\nsailmakers who were mending a topsail in the waist now and then he\\nstooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which\\notherwise might have been wasted\\n\\n\\nchapter 19 the prophet\\n\\nshipmates have ye shipped in that ship\\n\\nqueequeg and i had just left the pequod and were sauntering away from\\nthe water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when the\\nabove words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us\\nlevelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he was but\\nshabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a\\nblack handkerchief investing his neck a confluent smallpox had in all\\ndirections flowed over his face and left it like the complicated\\nribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried up\\n\\nhave ye shipped in her he repeated\\n\\nyou mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to gain a little\\nmore time for an uninterrupted look at him\\n\\naye the pequodthat ship there he said drawing back his whole arm\\nand then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the fixed\\nbayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object\\n\\nyes said i we have just signed the articles\\n\\nanything down there about your souls\\n\\nabout what\\n\\noh perhaps you havnt got any he said quickly no matter though\\ni know many chaps that havnt got anygood luck to em and they are\\nall the better off for it a souls a sort of a fifth wheel to a\\nwagon\\n\\nwhat are you jabbering about shipmate said i\\n\\n_hes_ got enough though to make up for all deficiencies of that\\nsort in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous\\nemphasis upon the word _he_\\n\\nqueequeg said i lets go this fellow has broken loose from\\nsomewhere hes talking about something and somebody we dont know\\n\\nstop cried the stranger ye said trueye havnt seen old thunder\\nyet have ye\\n\\nwhos old thunder said i again riveted with the insane earnestness\\nof his manner\\n\\ncaptain ahab\\n\\nwhat the captain of our ship the pequod\\n\\naye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name ye\\nhavnt seen him yet have ye\\n\\nno we havnt hes sick they say but is getting better and will be\\nall right again before long\\n\\nall right again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnly\\nderisive sort of laugh look ye when captain ahab is all right then\\nthis left arm of mine will be all right not before\\n\\nwhat do you know about him\\n\\nwhat did they _tell_ you about him say that\\n\\nthey didnt tell much of anything about him only ive heard that hes\\na good whalehunter and a good captain to his crew\\n\\nthats true thats trueyes both true enough but you must jump when\\nhe gives an order step and growl growl and gothats the word with\\ncaptain ahab but nothing about that thing that happened to him off\\ncape horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights\\nnothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar\\nin santaheard nothing about that eh nothing about the silver\\ncalabash he spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last\\nvoyage according to the prophecy didnt ye hear a word about them\\nmatters and something more eh no i dont think ye did how could ye\\nwho knows it not all nantucket i guess but howsever mayhap yeve\\nheard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of\\nthat i dare say oh yes _that_ every one knows amosti mean they\\nknow hes only one leg and that a parmacetti took the other off\\n\\nmy friend said i what all this gibberish of yours is about i\\ndont know and i dont much care for it seems to me that you must be\\na little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of captain ahab\\nof that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i know all\\nabout the loss of his leg\\n\\n_all_ about it ehsure you doall\\n\\npretty sure\\n\\nwith finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggarlike\\nstranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then starting a\\nlittle turned and saidyeve shipped have ye names down on the\\npapers well well whats signed is signed and whats to be will\\nbe and then again perhaps it wont be after all anyhow its all\\nfixed and arranged aready and some sailors or other must go with him\\ni suppose as well these as any other men god pity em morning to ye\\nshipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye im sorry i stopped\\nye\\n\\nlook here friend said i if you have anything important to tell\\nus out with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle us you are\\nmistaken in your game thats all i have to say\\n\\nand its said very well and i like to hear a chap talk up that way\\nyou are just the man for himthe likes of ye morning to ye shipmates\\nmorning oh when ye get there tell em ive concluded not to make one\\nof em\\n\\nah my dear fellow you cant fool us that wayyou cant fool us it\\nis the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a\\ngreat secret in him\\n\\nmorning to ye shipmates morning\\n\\nmorning it is said i come along queequeg lets leave this crazy\\nman but stop tell me your name will you\\n\\nelijah\\n\\nelijah thought i and we walked away both commenting after each\\nothers fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was\\nnothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not gone\\nperhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner and\\nlooking back as i did so who should be seen but elijah following us\\nthough at a distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that i\\nsaid nothing to queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my\\ncomrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner\\nthat we did he did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us\\nbut with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine this\\ncircumstance coupled with his ambiguous halfhinting halfrevealing\\nshrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments\\nand halfapprehensions and all connected with the pequod and captain\\nahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn fit and the silver\\ncalabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the ship\\nthe day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and the\\nvoyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowy\\nthings\\n\\ni was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really\\ndogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg\\nand on that side of it retraced our steps but elijah passed on\\nwithout seeming to notice us this relieved me and once more and\\nfinally as it seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbug\\n\\n\\nchapter 20 all astir\\n\\na day or two passed and there was great activity aboard the pequod\\nnot only were the old sails being mended but new sails were coming on\\nboard and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in short everything\\nbetokened that the ships preparations were hurrying to a close\\ncaptain peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam\\nkeeping a sharp lookout upon the hands bildad did all the purchasing\\nand providing at the stores and the men employed in the hold and on\\nthe rigging were working till long after nightfall\\n\\non the day following queequegs signing the articles word was given at\\nall the inns where the ships company were stopping that their chests\\nmust be on board before night for there was no telling how soon the\\nvessel might be sailing so queequeg and i got down our traps\\nresolving however to sleep ashore till the last but it seems they\\nalways give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not sail\\nfor several days but no wonder there was a good deal to be done and\\nthere is no telling how many things to be thought of before the pequod\\nwas fully equipped\\n\\nevery one knows what a multitude of thingsbeds saucepans knives and\\nforks shovels and tongs napkins nutcrackers and what not are\\nindispensable to the business of housekeeping just so with whaling\\nwhich necessitates a threeyears housekeeping upon the wide ocean far\\nfrom all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers and\\nthough this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any means\\nto the same extent as with whalemen for besides the great length of\\nthe whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution\\nof the fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote\\nharbors usually frequented it must be remembered that of all ships\\nwhaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds and\\nespecially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which\\nthe success of the voyage most depends hence the spare boats spare\\nspars and spare lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but\\na spare captain and duplicate ship\\n\\nat the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of the\\npequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water\\nfuel and iron hoops and staves but as before hinted for some time\\nthere was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and\\nends of things both large and small\\n\\nchief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captain\\nbildads sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable\\nspirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if _she_\\ncould help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod after\\nonce fairly getting to sea at one time she would come on board with a\\njar of pickles for the stewards pantry another time with a bunch of\\nquills for the chief mates desk where he kept his log a third time\\nwith a roll of flannel for the small of some ones rheumatic back\\nnever did any woman better deserve her name which was charityaunt\\ncharity as everybody called her and like a sister of charity did this\\ncharitable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn\\nher hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfort\\nand consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother\\nbildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two of\\nwellsaved dollars\\n\\nbut it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on\\nboard as she did the last day with a long oilladle in one hand and\\na still longer whaling lance in the other nor was bildad himself nor\\ncaptain peleg at all backward as for bildad he carried about with him\\na long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down\\nwent his mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in a\\nwhile peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the men\\ndown the hatchways roaring up to the riggers at the masthead and\\nthen concluded by roaring back into his wigwam\\n\\nduring these days of preparation queequeg and i often visited the\\ncraft and as often i asked about captain ahab and how he was and\\nwhen he was going to come on board his ship to these questions they\\nwould answer that he was getting better and better and was expected\\naboard every day meantime the two captains peleg and bildad could\\nattend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if i\\nhad been downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainly\\nin my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so\\nlong a voyage without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the\\nabsolute dictator of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open\\nsea but when a man suspects any wrong it sometimes happens that if he\\nbe already involved in the matter he insensibly strives to cover up\\nhis suspicions even from himself and much this way it was with me i\\nsaid nothing and tried to think nothing\\n\\nat last it was given out that some time next day the ship would\\ncertainly sail so next morning queequeg and i took a very early\\nstart\\n\\n\\nchapter 21 going aboard\\n\\nit was nearly six oclock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we\\ndrew nigh the wharf\\n\\nthere are some sailors running ahead there if i see right said i to\\nqueequeg it cant be shadows shes off by sunrise i guess come\\non\\n\\navast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close\\nbehind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuating\\nhimself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain\\ntwilight strangely peering from queequeg to me it was elijah\\n\\ngoing aboard\\n\\nhands off will you said i\\n\\nlookee here said queequeg shaking himself go way\\n\\naint going aboard then\\n\\nyes we are said i but what business is that of yours do you\\nknow mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent\\n\\nno no no i wasnt aware of that said elijah slowly and\\nwonderingly looking from me to queequeg with the most unaccountable\\nglances\\n\\nelijah said i you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing we\\nare going to the indian and pacific oceans and would prefer not to be\\ndetained\\n\\nye be be ye coming back afore breakfast\\n\\nhes cracked queequeg said i come on\\n\\nholloa cried stationary elijah hailing us when we had removed a few\\npaces\\n\\nnever mind him said i queequeg come on\\n\\nbut he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on my\\nshoulder saiddid ye see anything looking like men going towards that\\nship a while ago\\n\\nstruck by this plain matteroffact question i answered saying yes\\ni thought i did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure\\n\\nvery dim very dim said elijah morning to ye\\n\\nonce more we quitted him but once more he came softly after us and\\ntouching my shoulder again said see if you can find em now will\\nye\\n\\nfind who\\n\\nmorning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off oh i\\nwas going to warn ye againstbut never mind never mindits all one\\nall in the family toosharp frost this morning aint it goodbye to\\nye shant see ye again very soon i guess unless its before the\\ngrand jury and with these cracked words he finally departed leaving\\nme for the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence\\n\\nat last stepping on board the pequod we found everything in profound\\nquiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance was locked within the\\nhatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging going forward\\nto the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a\\nlight we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a\\ntattered peajacket he was thrown at whole length upon two chests his\\nface downwards and inclosed in his folded arms the profoundest slumber\\nslept upon him\\n\\nthose sailors we saw queequeg where can they have gone to said i\\nlooking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when on the\\nwharf queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence i\\nwould have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\\nmatter were it not for elijahs otherwise inexplicable question but i\\nbeat the thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to\\nqueequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body telling him to\\nestablish himself accordingly he put his hand upon the sleepers rear\\nas though feeling if it was soft enough and then without more ado\\nsat quietly down there\\n\\ngracious queequeg dont sit there said i\\n\\noh perry dood seat said queequeg my country way wont hurt him\\nface\\n\\nface said i call that his face very benevolent countenance then\\nbut how hard he breathes hes heaving himself get off queequeg you\\nare heavy its grinding the face of the poor get off queequeg look\\nhell twitch you off soon i wonder he dont wake\\n\\nqueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and\\nlighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the feet we kept the pipe passing\\nover the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon questioning\\nhim in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in his\\nland owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts the king\\nchiefs and great people generally were in the custom of fattening\\nsome of the lower orders for ottomans and to furnish a house\\ncomfortably in that respect you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy\\nfellows and lay them round in the piers and alcoves besides it was\\nvery convenient on an excursion much better than those gardenchairs\\nwhich are convertible into walkingsticks upon occasion a chief\\ncalling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himself\\nunder a spreading tree perhaps in some damp marshy place\\n\\nwhile narrating these things every time queequeg received the tomahawk\\nfrom me he flourished the hatchetside of it over the sleepers head\\n\\nwhats that for queequeg\\n\\nperry easy kille oh perry easy\\n\\nhe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawkpipe\\nwhich it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed\\nhis soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger the\\nstrong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole it began to\\ntell upon him he breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemed\\ntroubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and\\nrubbed his eyes\\n\\nholloa he breathed at last who be ye smokers\\n\\nshipped men answered i when does she sail\\n\\naye aye ye are going in her be ye she sails today the captain\\ncame aboard last night\\n\\nwhat captainahab\\n\\nwho but him indeed\\n\\ni was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab when we\\nheard a noise on deck\\n\\nholloa starbucks astir said the rigger hes a lively chief mate\\nthat good man and a pious but all alive now i must turn to and so\\nsaying he went on deck and we followed\\n\\nit was now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in twos and\\nthrees the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively\\nengaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various\\nlast things on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly\\nenshrined within his cabin\\n\\n\\nchapter 22 merry christmas\\n\\nat length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ships\\nriggers and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and\\nafter the everthoughtful charity had come off in a whaleboat with\\nher last gifta nightcap for stubb the second mate her\\nbrotherinlaw and a spare bible for the stewardafter all this the\\ntwo captains peleg and bildad issued from the cabin and turning to\\nthe chief mate peleg said\\n\\nnow mr starbuck are you sure everything is right captain ahab is\\nall readyjust spoke to himnothing more to be got from shore eh\\nwell call all hands then muster em aft hereblast em\\n\\nno need of profane words however great the hurry peleg said\\nbildad but away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding\\n\\nhow now here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captain\\npeleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the\\nquarterdeck just as if they were to be jointcommanders at sea as\\nwell as to all appearances in port and as for captain ahab no sign\\nof him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin but\\nthen the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary in\\ngetting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea indeed\\nas that was not at all his proper business but the pilots and as he\\nwas not yet completely recoveredso they saidtherefore captain ahab\\nstayed below and all this seemed natural enough especially as in the\\nmerchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a\\nconsiderable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the\\ncabin table having a farewell merrymaking with their shore friends\\nbefore they quit the ship for good with the pilot\\n\\nbut there was not much chance to think over the matter for captain\\npeleg was now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking and\\ncommanding and not bildad\\n\\naft here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingered at\\nthe mainmast mr starbuck drive em aft\\n\\nstrike the tent therewas the next order as i hinted before this\\nwhalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the\\npequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known\\nto be the next thing to heaving up the anchor\\n\\nman the capstan blood and thunderjumpwas the next command and\\nthe crew sprang for the handspikes\\n\\nnow in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot\\nis the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg be\\nit known in addition to his other officers was one of the licensed\\npilots of the porthe being suspected to have got himself made a pilot\\nin order to save the nantucket pilotfee to all the ships he was\\nconcerned in for he never piloted any other craftbildad i say might\\nnow be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the\\napproaching anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave\\nof psalmody to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some\\nsort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley with hearty good\\nwill nevertheless not three days previous bildad had told them that\\nno profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod particularly in\\ngetting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choice\\ncopy of watts in each seamans berth\\n\\nmeantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain peleg ripped\\nand swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost thought he\\nwould sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i\\npaused on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of\\nthe perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for\\na pilot i was comforting myself however with the thought that in\\npious bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred\\nand seventyseventh lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear\\nand turning round was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in\\nthe act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that was my\\nfirst kick\\n\\nis that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared\\nspring thou sheephead spring and break thy backbone why dont ye\\nspring i say all of yespring quohog spring thou chap with the red\\nwhiskers spring there scotchcap spring thou green pants spring i\\nsay all of ye and spring your eyes out and so saying he moved\\nalong the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while\\nimperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody thinks i\\ncaptain peleg must have been drinking something today\\n\\nat last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided it\\nwas a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merged into\\nnight we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose\\nfreezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor the long rows of\\nteeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and like the white\\nivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving icicles depended from\\nthe bows\\n\\nlank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon as\\nthe old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shivering\\nfrost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his\\nsteady notes were heard\\n\\n\\n_sweet fields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living\\ngreen so to the jews old canaan stood while jordan rolled between_\\n\\n\\n\\nnever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then they\\nwere full of hope and fruition spite of this frigid winter night in\\nthe boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there\\nwas yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and\\nmeads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the\\nspring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer\\n\\nat last we gained such an offing that the two pilots were needed no\\nlonger the stout sailboat that had accompanied us began ranging\\nalongside\\n\\nit was curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were affected\\nat this juncture

of his merits were\\nhe presented to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation\\nof the naval officers he should append the initials swf sperm whale\\nfishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed\\npreeminently presuming and ridiculous\\n\\ndoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us\\nwhalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a\\nbutchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein we\\nare surrounded by all manner of defilements butchers we are that is\\ntrue but butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been\\nall martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor and\\nas for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye\\nshall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally\\nunknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm\\nwhaleship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth but\\neven granting the charge in question to be true what disordered\\nslippery decks of a whaleship are comparable to the unspeakable\\ncarrion of those battlefields from which so many soldiers return to\\ndrink in all ladies plaudits and if the idea of peril so much\\nenhances the popular conceit of the soldiers profession let me assure\\nye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery would\\nquickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whales vast tail\\nfanning into eddies the air over his head for what are the\\ncomprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and\\nwonders of god\\n\\nbut though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it\\nunwittingly pay us the profoundest homage yea an allabounding\\nadoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles that burn\\nround the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory\\n\\nbut look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of\\nscales see what we whalemen are and have been\\n\\nwhy did the dutch in de witts time have admirals of their whaling\\nfleets why did louis xvi of france at his own personal expense fit\\nout whaling ships from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some\\nscore or two of families from our own island of nantucket why did\\nbritain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties\\nupwards of 1000000 and lastly how comes it that we whalemen of\\namerica now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world\\nsail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels manned by eighteen\\nthousand men yearly consuming 4000000 of dollars the ships worth\\nat the time of sailing 20000000 and every year importing into our\\nharbors a well reaped harvest of 7000000 how comes all this if\\nthere be not something puissant in

has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken\\nin one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one way\\nand another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves

alone to whom\\nthe credit will be due for already she is on the threshold\\n\\nbut if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling has no\\næsthetically noble associations connected with it

even\\nmodern ones a certain curious process of seasoning them for their\\nfunctions is gone through there is a saltcellar of state so called\\nand there may be a castor of state how they use the salt\\npreciselywho knows certain i am however that a kings head is\\nsolemnly oiled at his coronation even as a head of salad can it be\\nthough that they anoint it with a view of making its interior

was a long earnest man and though born on an\\nicy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes his flesh being\\nhard as twicebaked biscuit transported to the indies his live blood\\nwould not spoil like bottled ale he must have been born in some time\\nof general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which\\nhis state is famous only some thirty arid summers had he seen those\\nsummers had dried up all his physical superfluousness but this his\\nthinness so to speak seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties\\nand cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight it was\\nmerely the condensation of the man he was by no means illlooking\\nquite the contrary his pure tight skin was an excellent fit and\\nclosely wrapped up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength\\nlike a revivified egyptian this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for\\nlong ages to come and to endure always as now for be it polar snow\\nor torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality was\\nwarranted to do well in all climates looking into his eyes you seemed\\nto see there the yet lingering images of those thousandfold perils he\\nhad calmly confronted through life a staid steadfast man whose life\\nfor the most part was a telling pantomime of action and not a tame\\nchapter of sounds yet for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude there\\nwere certain qualities in him which at times affected and in some\\ncases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest uncommonly\\nconscientious for a seaman and endued with a deep natural reverence\\nthe wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline\\nhim to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in some\\norganizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than\\nfrom ignorance outward portents and inward presentiments were his and\\nif at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul much more\\ndid his faraway domestic memories of his young cape wife and child\\ntend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature\\nand open him still further to those latent influences which in some\\nhonesthearted men restrain the gush of daredevil daring so often\\nevinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery i\\nwill have no man in my boat said starbuck who is not afraid of a\\nwhale by this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliable and\\nuseful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the\\nencountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more\\ndangerous comrade than a coward\\n\\naye aye said stubb the second mate starbuck there is as\\ncareful a man as youll find anywhere in this fishery but we shall\\nere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a\\nman like stubb or almost any other whale hunter\\n\\nstarbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a\\nsentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon\\nall mortally practical occasions besides he thought perhaps that in\\nthis business of whaling courage was one of the great staple outfits\\nof the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly\\nwasted wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after\\nsundown nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted\\nin fighting him for thought starbuck i am here in this critical\\nocean to kill whales for my living and not to be killed by them for\\ntheirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew\\nwhat doom was his own fathers where in the bottomless deeps could\\nhe find the torn limbs of his brother\\n\\nwith memories like these in him and moreover given to a certain\\nsuperstitiousness as has been said the courage of this starbuck which\\ncould nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme but\\nit was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such\\nterrible experiences and remembrances as he had it was not in nature\\nthat these things should fail in latently engendering an element in\\nhim which under suitable circumstances would break out from its\\nconfinement and burn all his courage up and brave as he might be it\\nwas that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which\\nwhile generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas or winds or\\nwhales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world yet\\ncannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrors\\nwhich sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged\\nand mighty man\\n\\nbut were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete\\nabasement of poor starbucks fortitude scarce might i have the heart\\nto write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose\\nthe fall of valour in the soul men may seem detestable as joint\\nstockcompanies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be\\nmen may have mean and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble\\nand so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any\\nignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their\\ncostliest robes that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so\\nfar within us that it remains intact though all the outer character\\nseem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a\\nvalorruined man nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight\\ncompletely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars but\\nthis august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of kings and

o\\ngod\\n\\n\\nchapter 27 knights and squires\\n\\nstubb was the second mate he was a native of cape cod and hence\\naccording to local usage was called a capecodman a happygolucky\\nneither craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an\\nindifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the\\nchase toiling away calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged\\nfor the year goodhumored easy and careless he presided over his\\nwhaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his\\ncrew all invited guests he was as particular about the comfortable\\narrangement of his part of the boat as an old stagedriver is about\\nthe snugness of his box when close to the whale in the very\\ndeathlock of the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and\\noffhandedly as a whistling tinker his hammer he would hum over his\\nold rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated\\nmonster long usage had for this stubb converted the jaws of death\\ninto an easy chair what he thought of death itself there is no\\ntelling whether he ever thought of it at all might be a question\\nbut if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a\\ncomfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a\\nsort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir themselves there\\nabout something which he would find out when he obeyed the order and\\nnot sooner\\n\\nwhat perhaps with other things made stubb such an easygoing\\nunfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a\\nworld full of grave pedlars all bowed to the ground with their packs\\nwhat helped to bring about that almost impious goodhumor of his that\\nthing must have been his pipe for like his nose his short black\\nlittle pipe was one of the regular features of his face you would\\nalmost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his\\nnose as without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipes there ready\\nloaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever\\nhe turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from\\nthe other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in\\nreadiness anew for when stubb dressed instead of first putting his\\nlegs into his trowsers he put his pipe into his mouth\\n\\ni say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his\\npeculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air\\nwhether ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless\\nmiseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and as in\\ntime of the cholera some people go about with a camphorated\\nhandkerchief to their mouths so likewise against all mortal\\ntribulations stubbs tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of\\ndisinfecting agent\\n\\nthe third mate was flask a native of tisbury in marthas vineyard a\\nshort stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales\\nwho somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally\\nand hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was a sort of point of\\nhonor with him to destroy them whenever encountered so utterly lost\\nwas he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic\\nbulk and mystic ways and so dead to anything like an apprehension of\\nany possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion\\nthe wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse or at least\\nwaterrat requiring only a little circumvention and some small\\napplication of time and trouble in order to kill and boil this\\nignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in\\nthe matter of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a\\nthree years voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted\\nthat length of time as a carpenters nails are divided into wrought\\nnails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly divided little flask\\nwas one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long they\\ncalled him kingpost on board of the pequod because in form he could\\nbe well likened to the short square timber known by that name in\\narctic whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers\\ninserted into it serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions\\nof those battering seas\\n\\nnow these three matesstarbuck stubb and flask were momentous men\\nthey it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the\\npequods boats as headsmen in that grand order of battle in which\\ncaptain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the\\nwhales these three headsmen were as captains of companies or being\\narmed with their long keen whaling spears they were as a picked trio\\nof lancers even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins\\n\\nand since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic\\nknight of old is always accompanied by his boatsteerer or harpooneer\\nwho in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance when the\\nformer one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault and\\nmoreover as there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy\\nand friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we set\\ndown who the pequods harpooneers were and to what headsman each of\\nthem belonged\\n\\nfirst of all was queequeg whom starbuck the chief mate had selected\\nfor his squire but queequeg is already known\\n\\nnext was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly\\npromontory of marthas vineyard where there still exists the last\\nremnant of a village of red men which has long supplied the\\nneighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring\\nharpooneers in the fishery they usually go by the generic name of\\ngayheaders tashtegos long lean sable hair his high cheek bones\\nand black rounding eyesfor an indian oriental in their largeness but\\nantarctic in their glittering expressionall this sufficiently\\nproclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud\\nwarrior hunters who in quest of the great new england moose had\\nscoured bow in hand the aboriginal forests of the main but no longer\\nsnuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland tashtego now\\nhunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea the unerring harpoon\\nof the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires to look\\nat the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs you would almost have\\ncredited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans and\\nhalfbelieved this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers\\nof the air tashtego was stubb the second mates squire\\n\\nthird among the harpooneers was daggoo a gigantic coalblack\\nnegrosavage with a lionlike treadan ahasuerus to behold suspended\\nfrom his ears were two golden hoops so large that the sailors called\\nthem ringbolts and would talk of securing the topsail halyards to\\nthem in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler\\nlying in a lonely bay on his native coast and never having been\\nanywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the pagan harbors\\nmost frequented by whalemen and having now led for many years the bold\\nlife of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what\\nmanner of men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues\\nand erect as a giraffe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six\\nfeet five in his socks there was a corporeal humility in looking up at\\nhim and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to\\nbeg truce of a fortress curious to tell this imperial negro\\nahasuerus daggoo was the squire of little flask who looked like a\\nchessman beside him as for the residue of the pequods company be it\\nsaid that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men\\nbefore the mast employed in the american whale fishery are americans\\nborn though pretty nearly all the officers are herein it is the same\\nwith the american whale fishery as with the american army and military\\nand merchant navies and the engineering forces employed in the\\nconstruction of the american canals and railroads the same i say\\nbecause in all these cases the native american liberally provides the\\nbrains the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles no\\nsmall

of captain ahab the mates regularly relieved each other at the\\nwatches and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemed\\nto be the only commanders of the ship only they sometimes issued

seemed against all warrantry to cherish such\\nemotions for though the harpooneers with the great body of the crew\\nwere a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the\\ntame merchantship companies which my previous experiences had made me\\nacquainted with still i ascribed thisand rightly ascribed itto the\\nfierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation\\nin which i had so abandonedly embarked but it was especially the\\naspect of the three chief officers of the ship the mates which was\\nmost forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings and\\ninduce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage\\nthree better more likely seaofficers and men each in his own\\ndifferent way could not readily be found and they were every one of\\nthem americans a nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now it being\\nchristmas when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we had\\nbiting polar weather though all the time running away from it to the\\nsouthward and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed\\ngradually leaving that merciless winter and all its intolerable\\nweather behind us it was one of those less lowering but still grey\\nand gloomy enough mornings of the transition when with a fair wind the\\nship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping\\nand melancholy rapidity that as i mounted to the deck at the call of\\nthe forenoon watch so soon as i levelled my glance towards the\\ntaffrail foreboding shivers ran over me reality outran apprehension\\ncaptain ahab stood upon his quarterdeck\\n\\nthere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of the\\nrecovery from any he looked like a man cut away from the stake when\\nthe fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them\\nor taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness his\\nwhole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an\\nunalterable mould like cellinis cast perseus threading its way out\\nfrom among his grey hairs and continuing right down one side of his\\ntawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you\\nsaw a slender rodlike mark lividly whitish it resembled that\\nperpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of a\\ngreat tree when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it and\\nwithout wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark from\\ntop to bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still\\ngreenly alive but branded whether that mark was born with him or\\nwhether it was the scar left by some desperate wound no one could\\ncertainly say by some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or\\nno allusion was made to it especially by the mates but once\\ntashtegos senior an old gayhead indian among the crew\\nsuperstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did\\nahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in the\\nfury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea yet this\\nwild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey manxman\\ninsinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out\\nof nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab nevertheless\\nthe old seatraditions the immemorial credulities popularly invested\\nthis old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment so that no\\nwhite sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever\\ncaptain ahab should be tranquilly laid outwhich might hardly come to\\npass so he mutteredthen whoever should do that last office for the\\ndead would find a birthmark on him from crown to sole\\n\\nso powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me and the\\nlivid brand which streaked it that for the first few moments i hardly\\nnoted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the\\nbarbaric white leg upon which he partly stood it had previously come\\nto me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished\\nbone of the sperm whales jaw aye he was dismasted off japan said\\nthe old gayhead indian once but like his dismasted craft he shipped\\nanother mast without coming home for it he has a quiver of em\\n\\ni was struck with the singular posture he maintained upon each side of\\nthe pequods quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds\\nthere was an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the\\nplank his bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and\\nholding by a shroud captain ahab stood erect looking straight out\\nbeyond the ships everpitching prow there was an infinity of firmest\\nfortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and\\nfearless forward dedication of that glance not a word he spoke nor\\ndid his officers say aught to him though by all their minutest\\ngestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not\\npainful consciousness of being under a troubled mastereye and not\\nonly that but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion\\nin his face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some\\nmighty woe\\n\\nere long from his first visit in the air he withdrew into his cabin\\nbut after that morning he was every day visible to the crew either\\nstanding in his pivothole or seated upon an ivory stool he had or\\nheavily walking the deck as the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to\\ngrow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as if\\nwhen the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry\\nbleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded and by and by it\\ncame to pass that he was almost continually in the air but as yet\\nfor all that he said or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck he\\nseemed as unnecessary there as another mast but the pequod was only\\nmaking a passage now not regularly cruising nearly all whaling\\npreparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to so\\nthat there was little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite\\nahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the clouds that\\nlayer upon layer were piled upon his brow as ever all clouds choose\\nthe loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon\\n\\nnevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the\\npleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm him\\nfrom his mood for as when the redcheeked dancing girls april and\\nmay trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest\\nruggedest most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth some\\nfew green sprouts to welcome such gladhearted visitants so ahab did\\nin the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish\\nair more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look\\nwhich in any other man would have soon flowered out in a smile\\n\\n\\nchapter 29 enter ahab to him stubb\\n\\nsome days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the pequod now went\\nrolling through the bright quito spring which at sea almost\\nperpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the\\ntropic the warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing\\nredundant days were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet heaped\\nupflaked up with rosewater snow the starred and stately nights\\nseemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets nursing at home in lonely\\npride the memory of their absent conquering earls the golden helmeted\\nsuns for sleeping man twas hard to choose between such winsome days\\nand such seducing nights but all the witcheries of that unwaning\\nweather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward\\nworld inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mild\\nhours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the clear ice\\nmost forms of noiseless twilights and all these subtle agencies more\\nand more they wrought on ahabs texture\\n\\nold age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life the less\\nman has to do with aught that looks like death among seacommanders\\nthe old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the\\nnightcloaked deck it was so with ahab only that now of late he\\nseemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visits\\nwere more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks it feels\\nlike going down into ones tombhe would mutter to himselffor an\\nold captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to my\\ngravedug berth\\n\\nso almost every twentyfour hours when the watches of the night were\\nset and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below\\nand when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailors\\nflung it not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt\\nit to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates when\\nthis sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the\\nsilent steersman would watch the cabinscuttle and ere long the old\\nman would emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled\\nway some considering touch of humanity was in him for at times like\\nthese he usually abstained from patrolling the quarterdeck because\\nto his wearied mates seeking repose within six inches of his ivory\\nheel such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony\\nstep that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of\\nsharks but once the mood was on him too deep for common regardings\\nand as with heavy lumberlike pace he was measuring the ship from\\ntaffrail to mainmast stubb the old second mate came up from below\\nwith a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that if\\ncaptain ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say\\nnay but there might be some way of muffling the noise hinting\\nsomething indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the\\ninsertion into it of the ivory heel ah stubb thou didst not know\\nahab then\\n\\nam i a cannonball stubb said ahab that thou wouldst wad me that\\nfashion but go thy ways i had forgot below to thy nightly grave\\nwhere such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling one at\\nlastdown dog and kennel\\n\\nstarting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly\\nscornful old man stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedly\\ni am not used to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than half\\nlike it sir\\n\\navast gritted ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away\\nas if to avoid some passionate temptation\\n\\nno sir not yet said stubb emboldened i will not tamely be\\ncalled a dog sir\\n\\nthen be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass and begone\\nor ill clear the world of thee\\n\\nas he said this ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors\\nin his aspect that stubb involuntarily retreated\\n\\ni was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it\\nmuttered stubb as he found himself descending the cabinscuttle its\\nvery queer stop stubb somehow now i dont well know whether to go\\nback and strike him orwhats thatdown here on my knees and pray for\\nhim yes that was the thought coming up in me but it would be the\\nfirst time i ever _did_ pray its queer very queer and hes queer\\ntoo aye take him fore and aft hes about the queerest old man stubb\\never sailed with how he flashed at mehis eyes like powderpans is\\nhe mad anyway theres something on his mind as sure as there must be\\nsomething on a deck when it cracks he aint in his bed now either\\nmore than three hours out of the twentyfour and he dont sleep then\\ndidnt that doughboy the steward tell me that of a morning he always\\nfinds the old mans hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the\\nsheets down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knots and\\nthe pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick had been on\\nit a hot old man i guess hes got what some folks ashore call a\\nconscience its a kind of ticdollyrow they sayworse nor a\\ntoothache well well i dont know what it is but the lord keep me\\nfrom catching it hes full of riddles i wonder what he goes into the\\nafter hold for every night as doughboy tells me he suspects whats\\nthat for i should like to know whos made appointments with him in\\nthe hold aint that queer now but theres no telling its the old\\ngamehere goes for a snooze damn me its worth a fellows while to be\\nborn into the world if only to fall right asleep and now that i think\\nof it thats about the first thing babies do and thats a sort of\\nqueer too damn me but all things are queer come to think of em\\nbut thats against my principles think not is my eleventh\\ncommandment and sleep when you can is my twelfthso here goes again\\nbut hows that didnt he call me a dog blazes he called me ten times\\na donkey and piled a lot of jackasses on top of _that_ he might as\\nwell have kicked me and done with it maybe he _did_ kick me and i\\ndidnt observe it i was so taken all aback with his brow somehow it\\nflashed like a bleached bone what the devils the matter with me i\\ndont stand right on my legs coming afoul of that old man has a sort\\nof turned me wrong side out by the lord i must have been dreaming\\nthoughhow how howbut the only ways to stash it so here goes to\\nhammock again and in the morning ill see how this plaguey juggling\\nthinks over by daylight\\n\\n\\nchapter 30 the pipe\\n\\nwhen stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over the\\nbulwarks and then as had been usual with him of late calling a\\nsailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also\\nhis pipe lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool\\non the weather side of the deck he sat and smoked\\n\\nin old norse times the thrones of the sealoving danish kings were\\nfabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale how could\\none look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bones without\\nbethinking him of the royalty it symbolized for a khan of the plank\\nand a king of the sea and a great lord of leviathans was ahab\\n\\nsome moments passed during which the thick vapor came from his mouth\\nin quick and constant puffs which blew back again into his face how\\nnow he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube this smoking no\\nlonger soothes oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be\\ngone here have i been unconsciously toiling not pleasuringaye and\\nignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward and with\\nsuch nervous whiffs as if like the dying whale my final jets were\\nthe strongest and fullest of trouble what business have i with this\\npipe this thing that is meant for sereneness to send up mild white\\nvapors among mild white hairs not among torn irongrey locks like\\nmine ill smoke no more\\n\\nhe tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea the fire hissed in the\\nwaves the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe\\nmade with slouched hat ahab lurchingly paced the planks\\n\\n\\nchapter 31 queen mab\\n\\nnext morning stubb accosted flask\\n\\nsuch a queer dream kingpost i never had you know the old mans\\nivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i tried to\\nkick back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right off and\\nthen presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i like a blazing fool kept\\nkicking at it but what was still more curious flaskyou know how\\ncurious all dreams arethrough all this rage that i was in i somehow\\nseemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an\\ninsult that kick from ahab why thinks i whats the row its not\\na real leg only a false leg and theres a mighty difference between\\na living thump and a dead thump thats what makes a blow from the\\nhand flask fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane\\nthe living memberthat makes the living insult my little man and\\nthinks i to myself all the while mind while i was stubbing my silly\\ntoes against that cursed pyramidso confoundedly contradictory was it\\nall all the while i say i was thinking to myself whats his leg\\nnow but a canea whalebone cane yes thinks i it was only a\\nplayful cudgellingin fact only a whaleboning that he gave menot a\\nbase kick besides thinks i look at it once why the end of itthe\\nfoot partwhat a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed\\nfarmer kicked me _theres_ a devilish broad insult but this insult is\\nwhittled down to a point only but now comes the greatest joke of the\\ndream flask while i was battering away at the pyramid a sort of\\nbadgerhaired old merman with a hump on his back takes me by the\\nshoulders and slews me round what are you bout says he slid\\nman but i was frightened such a phiz but somehow next moment i was\\nover the fright what am i about says i at last and what business\\nis that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do _you_ want a\\nkick by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turned\\nround his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he\\nhad for a cloutwhat do you think i sawwhy thunder alive man his\\nstern was stuck full of marlinspikes with the points out says i on\\nsecond thoughts i guess i wont kick you old fellow wise stubb\\nsaid he wise stubb and kept muttering it all the time a sort of\\neating of his own gums like a chimney hag seeing he wasnt going to\\nstop saying over his wise stubb wise stubb i thought i might as\\nwell fall to kicking the pyramid again but i had only just lifted my\\nfoot for it when he roared out stop that kicking halloa says i\\nwhats the matter now old fellow look ye here says he lets\\nargue the insult captain ahab kicked ye didnt he yes he did\\nsays iright _here_ it was very good says hehe used his ivory\\nleg didnt he yes he did says i well then says he wise\\nstubb what have you to complain of didnt he kick with right good\\nwill it wasnt a common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it no you\\nwere kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb its\\nan honor i consider it an honor listen wise stubb in old england\\nthe greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and\\nmade garterknights of but be _your_ boast stubb that ye were\\nkicked by old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say _be_\\nkicked by him account his kicks honors and on no account kick back\\nfor you cant help yourself wise stubb dont you see that pyramid\\nwith that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to\\nswim off into the air i snored rolled over and there i was in my\\nhammock now what do you think of that dream flask\\n\\ni dont know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho\\n\\nmay be may be but its made a wise man of me flask dye see ahab\\nstanding there sideways looking over the stern well the best thing\\nyou can do flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him\\nwhatever he says halloa whats that he shouts hark\\n\\nmasthead there look sharp all of ye there are whales hereabouts\\n\\nif ye see a white one split your lungs for him\\n\\nwhat do you think of that now flask aint there a small drop of\\nsomething queer about that eh a white whaledid ye mark that man\\nlook yetheres something special in the wind stand by for it flask\\nahab has that thats bloody on his mind but mum he comes this way\\n\\n\\nchapter 32 cetology\\n\\nalready we are boldly launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost\\nin its unshored harbourless immensities ere that come to pass ere\\nthe pequods weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of\\nthe leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter\\nalmost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the\\nmore special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which\\nare to follow\\n\\nit is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera\\nthat i would now fain put before you yet is it no easy task the\\nclassification of the constituents of a chaos nothing less is here\\nessayed listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down\\n\\nno branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled\\ncetology says captain scoresby ad 1820\\n\\nit is not my intention were it in my power to

generalizing purpose all these have written the above\\ncited extracts will show\\n\\nof the names in this list of whale authors only those following owen\\never saw living whales and but one of them was a real professional\\nharpooneer and whaleman i mean captain scoresby on the separate\\nsubject of the greenland or rightwhale he is the best existing\\nauthority but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great\\nsperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy\\nmentioning and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper\\nupon the throne of the seas he is not even by any means the largest of\\nthe whales yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the\\nprofound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the\\nthen fabulous or utterly unknown spermwhale and which ignorance to\\nthis present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats\\nand whaleports this usurpation has been every way complete reference\\nto nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past\\ndays will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one rival was\\nto them the monarch of the seas but the time has at last come for a\\nnew proclamation this is charing cross hear ye good people allthe\\ngreenland whale is deposedthe great sperm whale now reigneth\\n\\nthere are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the\\nliving sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest\\ndegree succeed in the attempt those books are beales and bennetts\\nboth in their time surgeons to english southsea whaleships and both\\nexact and reliable men the original matter touching the sperm whale to\\nbe found in their volumes is necessarily small but so far as it goes\\nit is of excellent quality though mostly confined to scientific\\ndescription as yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic\\nlives not complete in any literature far above all other hunted\\nwhales his is an unwritten life\\n\\nnow the various species of whales need some sort of popular\\ncomprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the\\npresent hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent\\nlaborers as no better man advances to take this matter in hand i\\nhereupon offer my own poor endeavors i promise nothing complete\\nbecause any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very\\nreason infallibly be faulty i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical\\ndescription of the various species orin this place at leastto much\\nof any description my object here is simply to project the draught of\\na systematization of cetology i am the architect not the builder\\n\\nbut it is a ponderous task no ordinary lettersorter in the\\npostoffice is equal to it to grope down into the bottom of the sea\\nafter them to have ones hands among the unspeakable foundations\\nribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing what am i\\nthat i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awful\\ntauntings in job might well appal me will he the leviathan make a\\ncovenant with thee behold the hope of him is vain but i have swam\\nthrough libraries and sailed through oceans i have had to do with\\nwhales with these visible hands i am in earnest and i will try there\\nare some preliminaries to settle\\n\\nfirst the uncertain unsettled condition of this science of cetology\\nis in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters it\\nstill remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish in his system of\\nnature ad 1776 linnæus declares i hereby separate the whales from\\nthe fish but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year 1850\\nsharks and shad alewives and herring against linnæuss express edict\\nwere still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the\\nleviathan\\n\\nthe grounds upon which linnæus would fain have banished the whales from\\nthe waters he states as follows on account of their warm bilocular\\nheart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penem\\nintrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege naturæ jure\\nmeritoque i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley\\ncoffin of nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and\\nthey united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether\\ninsufficient charley profanely hinted they were humbug\\n\\nbe it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashioned\\nground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back me\\nthis fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal\\nrespect does the whale differ from other fish above linnæus has given\\nyou those items but in brief they are these lungs and warm blood\\nwhereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded\\n\\nnext how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so as\\nconspicuously to label him for all time to come to be short then a\\nwhale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_ there you have him\\nhowever contracted that definition is the result of expanded\\nmeditation a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not a\\nfish because he is amphibious but the last term of the definition is\\nstill more cogent as coupled with the first almost any one must have\\nnoticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat but a\\nvertical or upanddown tail whereas among spouting fish the tail\\nthough it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontal\\nposition\\n\\nby the above definition of what a whale is i do by no means exclude\\nfrom the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\\nwith the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the other\\nhand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\\nalien hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fish\\nmust be included in this groundplan of cetology now then come the\\ngrand divisions of the entire whale host\\n\\ni am aware that down to the present time the fish styled lamatins and\\ndugongs pigfish and sowfish of the coffins of nantucket are\\nincluded by many naturalists among the whales but as these pigfish\\nare a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers\\nand feeding on wet hay and especially as they do not spout i deny\\ntheir credentials as whales and have presented them with their\\npassports to quit the kingdom of cetology\\n\\nfirst according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primary\\nbooks subdivisible into chapters and these shall comprehend them\\nall both small and large\\n\\ni the folio whale ii the octavo whale iii the duodecimo whale\\n\\nas the type of the folio i present the _sperm whale_ of the octavo\\nthe _grampus_ of the duodecimo the _porpoise_\\n\\nfolios among these i here include the following chaptersi the\\n_sperm whale_ ii the _right whale_ iii the _finback whale_ iv\\nthe _humpbacked whale_ v the _razor back whale_ vi the _sulphur\\nbottom whale_\\n\\nbook i _folio_ chapter i _sperm whale_this whale among the\\nenglish of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale and the physeter\\nwhale and the anvil headed whale is the present cachalot of the\\nfrench and the pottsfich of the germans and the macrocephalus of the\\nlong words he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe\\nthe most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic in\\naspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being the\\nonly creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti is\\nobtained all his peculiarities will in many other places be enlarged\\nupon it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do philologically\\nconsidered it is absurd some centuries ago when the sperm whale was\\nalmost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality and when his oil\\nwas only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish in those days\\nspermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived from a\\ncreature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland\\nor right whale it was the idea also that this same spermaceti was\\nthat quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable\\nof the word literally expresses in those times also spermaceti was\\nexceedingly scarce not being used for light but only as an ointment\\nand medicament it was only to be had from the druggists as you\\nnowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb when as i opine in the course of\\ntime the true nature of spermaceti became known its original name was\\nstill retained by the dealers no doubt to enhance its value by a\\nnotion so strangely significant of its scarcity and so the appellation\\nmust at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this\\nspermaceti was really derived\\n\\nbook i _folio_ chapter ii _right whale_in one respect this is\\nthe most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularly\\nhunted by man it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or\\nbaleen and the oil specially known as whale oil an inferior article\\nin commerce among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by\\nall the following titles the whale the greenland whale the black\\nwhale the great whale the true whale the right whale there is a\\ndeal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus\\nmultitudinously baptised what then is the whale which i include in\\nthe second species of my folios it is the great mysticetus of the\\nenglish naturalists the greenland whale of the english whalemen the\\nbaleine ordinaire of the french whalemen the growlands walfish of the\\nswedes it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been\\nhunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas it is the whale\\nwhich the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean on\\nthe brazil banks on the nor west coast and various other parts of\\nthe world designated by them right whale cruising grounds\\n\\nsome pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the\\nenglish and the right whale of the americans but they precisely agree\\nin all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single\\ndeterminate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction it is by\\nendless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences that\\nsome departments of natural

having the baleen in his mouth the\\nfinback is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic\\nspecies denominated _whalebone whales_ that is whales with baleen of\\nthese so called whalebone whales there would seem to be several\\nvarieties most of which however are little known broadnosed whales\\nand beaked whales pikeheaded whales bunched whales underjawed\\nwhales and rostrated whales are the fishermens names for a few sorts\\n\\nin connection with this appellative of whalebone whales it is of\\ngreat importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be\\nconvenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales yet it is\\nin vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan founded\\nupon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that\\nthose marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to\\nafford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other\\ndetached bodily distinctions which the whale in his kinds presents\\nhow then the baleen hump backfin and teeth these are things whose\\npeculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales\\nwithout any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in\\nother and more essential particulars thus the sperm whale and the\\nhumpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases\\nthen this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these\\nhas baleen but there again the similitude ceases and it is just the\\nsame with the other parts above mentioned in various sorts of whales\\nthey form such irregular combinations or in the case of any one of\\nthem detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all\\ngeneral methodization formed upon such a basis on this rock every one\\nof the whalenaturalists has split\\n\\nbut it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of the\\nwhale in his anatomythere at least we shall be able to hit the\\nright classification nay what thing for example is there in the\\ngreenland whales anatomy more striking than his baleen yet we have\\nseen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\\ngreenland whale and if you descend into the bowels of the various\\nleviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as\\navailable to the systematizer as those external ones already\\nenumerated what then remains nothing but to take hold of the whales\\nbodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way\\nand this is the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only\\none that can possibly succeed for it alone is practicable to proceed\\n\\nbook i _folio_ chapter iv _hump back_this whale is often seen\\non the northern american coast he has been frequently captured there\\nand towed into harbor he has a great pack on him like a peddler or\\nyou might call him the elephant and castle whale at any rate the\\npopular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the\\nsperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one his oil is not very\\nvaluable he has baleen he is the most gamesome and lighthearted of\\nall the whales making more gay foam and white water generally than any\\nother of them\\n\\nbook i _folio_ chapter v _razor back_of this whale little is\\nknown but his name i have seen him at a distance off cape horn of a\\nretiring nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers though no\\ncoward he has never yet shown any part of him but his back which\\nrises in a long sharp ridge let him go i know little more of him nor\\ndoes anybody else\\n\\nbook i _folio_ chapter vi _sulphur bottom_another retiring\\ngentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along the\\ntartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings he is seldom seen\\nat least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas and\\nthen always at too great a distance to study his countenance he is\\nnever chased he would run away with ropewalks of line prodigies are\\ntold of him adieu sulphur bottom i can say nothing more that is true\\nof ye nor can the oldest nantucketer\\n\\nthus ends book i _folio_ and now

the _killer_\\n\\nwhy this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain\\nbecause while the whales of this order though smaller than those of\\nthe former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them\\nin figure yet the bookbinders quarto volume in its dimensioned form\\ndoes not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume\\ndoes\\n\\nbook ii _octavo_ chapter i _grampus_though this fish whose\\nloud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has furnished a proverb to\\nlandsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not\\npopularly classed among whales but possessing all the grand\\ndistinctive features of the leviathan most naturalists have recognised\\nhim for one he is of moderate octavo size varying from fifteen to\\ntwentyfive feet in length and of corresponding dimensions round the\\nwaist he swims in herds he is never regularly hunted though his oil\\nis considerable in quantity and pretty good for light by some\\nfishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the\\ngreat sperm whale\\n\\nbook ii _octavo_ chapter ii _black fish_i give the popular\\nfishermens names for all these fish for generally they are the best\\nwhere any name happens to be vague or inexpressive i shall say so and\\nsuggest another i do so now touching the black fish socalled\\nbecause blackness is the rule among almost all whales so call him the\\nhyena whale if you please his voracity is well known and from the\\ncircumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards he\\ncarries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face this whale\\naverages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length he is found in almost\\nall latitudes he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin\\nin swimming which looks something like a roman nose when not more\\nprofitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the\\nhyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic\\nemploymentas some frugal housekeepers in the absence of company and\\nquite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax\\nthough their blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield you\\nupwards of thirty gallons of oil\\n\\nbook ii _octavo_ chapter iii _narwhale_ that is _nostril\\nwhale_another instance of a curiously named whale so named i suppose\\nfrom his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose the\\ncreature is some sixteen feet in length while its horn averages five\\nfeet though some exceed ten and even attain to fifteen feet strictly\\nspeaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the jaw\\nin a line a little depressed from the horizontal but it is only found\\non the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its owner\\nsomething analogous to the aspect of a clumsy lefthanded man what\\nprecise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers it would be hard to\\nsay it does not seem to be used like the blade of the swordfish and\\nbillfish though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it for\\na rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food charley coffin\\nsaid it was used for an icepiercer for the narwhale rising to the\\nsurface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrusts his\\nhorn up and so breaks through but you cannot prove either of these\\nsurmises to be correct my own opinion is that however this onesided\\nhorn may really be used by the narwhalehowever that may beit would\\ncertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets\\nthe narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale the horned whale\\nand the unicorn whale he is certainly a curious example of the\\nunicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature from\\ncertain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same\\nseaunicorns horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote\\nagainst poison and as such preparations of it brought immense prices\\nit was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same\\nway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn\\noriginally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity\\nblack letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that\\nvoyage when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him\\nfrom a window of greenwich palace as his bold ship sailed down the\\nthames when sir martin returned from that voyage saith black\\nletter on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long\\nhorn of the narwhale which for a long period after hung in the castle\\nat windsor an irish author avers that the earl of leicester on\\nbended knees did likewise present to her highness another horn\\npertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature\\n\\nthe narwhale has a very picturesque leopardlike look being of a\\nmilkwhite ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of black\\nhis oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it\\nand he is seldom hunted he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas\\n\\nbook ii _octavo_ chapter iv _killer_of this whale little is\\nprecisely known to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the professed\\nnaturalist from what i have seen of him at a distance i should say\\nthat he was about the bigness of a grampus he is very savagea sort of\\nfeegee fish he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip and\\nhangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death\\nthe killer is never hunted i never heard what sort of oil he has\\nexception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the\\nground of its indistinctness for we are all killers on land and on\\nsea bonapartes and sharks included\\n\\nbook ii _octavo_ chapter v _thrasher_this gentleman is famous\\nfor his tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes he\\nmounts the folio whales back and as he swims he works his passage by\\nflogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar\\nprocess still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer both\\nare outlaws even in the lawless seas\\n\\n thus ends book ii _octavo_ and begins book iii _duodecimo_\\n\\nduodecimoesthese include the smaller whales i the huzza porpoise\\nii the algerine porpoise iii the mealymouthed porpoise\\n\\nto those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may\\npossibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five\\nfeet should be marshalled among whalesa word which in the popular\\nsense always conveys an idea of hugeness but the creatures set down\\nabove as duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of my\\ndefinition of what a whale is_ie_ a spouting fish with a horizontal\\ntail\\n\\nbook iii _duodecimo_ chapter 1 _huzza porpoise_this is the\\ncommon porpoise found almost all over the globe the name is of my own\\nbestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises and something\\nmust be done to distinguish them i call him thus because he always\\nswims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossing\\nthemselves to heaven like caps in a fourthofjuly crowd their\\nappearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner full of\\nfine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward\\nthey are the lads that always live before the wind they are accounted\\na lucky omen if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding\\nthese vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly\\ngamesomeness is not in ye a wellfed plump huzza porpoise will yield\\nyou one good gallon of good oil but the fine and delicate fluid\\nextracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable it is in request among\\njewellers and watchmakers sailors put it on their hones porpoise meat\\nis good eating you know it may never have occurred to you that a\\nporpoise spouts indeed his spout is so small that it is not very\\nreadily discernible but the next time you have a chance watch him\\nand you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature\\n\\nbook iii _duodecimo_ chapter ii _algerine porpoise_a pirate\\nvery savage he is only found i think in the pacific he is somewhat\\nlarger than the huzza porpoise but much of the same general make\\nprovoke him and he will buckle to a shark i have lowered for him many\\ntimes but never yet saw him captured\\n\\nbook iii _duodecimo_ chapter iii _mealymouthed porpoise_the\\nlargest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific so far as it\\nis known the only english name by which he has hitherto been\\ndesignated is that of the fishersrightwhale porpoise from the\\ncircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio in\\nshape he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise being of a\\nless rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of quite a neat and\\ngentlemanlike figure he has no fins on his back most other porpoises\\nhave he has a lovely tail and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel\\nhue but his mealymouth spoils all though his entire back down to his\\nside fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the mark\\nin a ships hull called the bright waist that line streaks him from\\nstem to stern with two separate colours black above and white below\\nthe white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth which\\nmakes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a\\nmealbag a most mean and mealy aspect his oil is much like that of\\nthe common porpoise\\n\\n       \\n\\nbeyond the duodecimo this system does not proceed inasmuch as the\\nporpoise is the smallest of the whales above you have all the\\nleviathans of note but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive\\nhalffabulous whales which as an american whaleman i know by\\nreputation but not personally i shall enumerate them by their\\nforecastle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable to\\nfuture investigators who may complete what i have here but begun if\\nany of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then\\nhe can readily be incorporated into this system according to his\\nfolio octavo or duodecimo magnitudethe bottlenose whale the junk\\nwhale the puddingheaded whale the cape whale the leading whale the\\ncannon whale the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale\\nthe iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale etc from icelandic\\ndutch and old english authorities there might be quoted other lists\\nof uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names but i\\nomit them as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them\\nfor mere sounds full of leviathanism but signifying nothing\\n\\nfinally it was stated at the outset that this system would not be\\nhere and at once perfected you cannot but plainly see that i have\\nkept my word but i now leave my cetological system standing thus\\nunfinished even as the great cathedral of cologne was left with the\\ncrane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower for small\\nerections may be finished by their first architects grand ones true\\nones ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from ever\\ncompleting anything this whole book is but a draughtnay but the\\ndraught of a draught oh time strength cash and patience\\n\\n\\nchapter 33 the specksnyder\\n\\nconcerning the officers of the whalecraft this seems as good a place\\nas any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipboard arising\\nfrom the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class unknown\\nof course in any other marine than the whalefleet\\n\\nthe large importance attached to the harpooneers vocation is evinced\\nby the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two centuries\\nand more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the\\nperson now called the captain but was divided between him and an\\nofficer called the specksnyder literally this word means fatcutter\\nusage however in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer in\\nthose days the captains authority was restricted to the navigation\\nand general management of the vessel while over the whalehunting\\ndepartment and all its concerns the specksnyder or chief harpooneer\\nreigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted\\ntitle of specksioneer this old dutch official is still retained but\\nhis former dignity is sadly abridged at present he ranks simply as\\nsenior harpooneer and as such is but one of the captains more\\ninferior subalterns nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the\\nharpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since\\nin the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the\\nboat but under certain circumstances night watches on a whaling\\nground the command of the ships deck is also his therefore the grand\\npolitical maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart\\nfrom the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished as their\\nprofessional superior though always by them familiarly regarded as\\ntheir social equal\\n\\nnow the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea is\\nthisthe first lives aft the last forward hence in whaleships and\\nmerchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain and\\nso too in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\\nthe after part of the ship that is to say they take their meals in\\nthe captains cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with\\nit\\n\\nthough the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longest\\nof all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar perils of it and\\nthe community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom high\\nor low depend for their profits not upon fixed wages but upon their\\ncommon luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and\\nhard work though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a\\nless rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet never mind\\nhow much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some\\nprimitive instances live together for all that the punctilious\\nexternals at least of the quarterdeck are seldom materially relaxed\\nand in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket ships in\\nwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarterdeck with an elated\\ngrandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost as\\nmuch outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not the\\nshabbiest of pilotcloth\\n\\nand though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least\\ngiven to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage\\nhe ever exacted was implicit instantaneous obedience though he\\nrequired no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the\\nquarterdeck and though there were times when owing to peculiar\\ncircumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed he\\naddressed them in unusual terms whether of condescension or _in\\nterrorem_ or otherwise yet even captain ahab was by no means\\nunobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea\\n\\nnor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behind\\nthose forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himself\\nincidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than\\nthey were legitimately intended to subserve that certain sultanism of\\nhis brain which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested\\nthrough those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an\\nirresistible dictatorship for be a mans intellectual superiority what\\nit will it can never assume the practical available supremacy over\\nother men without the aid of some sort of external arts and\\nentrenchments always in themselves more or less paltry and base\\nthis it is that for ever keeps gods true princes of the empire from\\nthe worlds hustings and leaves the highest honors that this air can\\ngive to those men who become famous more through their infinite\\ninferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert than\\nthrough their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass\\nsuch large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political\\nsuperstitions invest them that in some royal instances even to idiot\\nimbecility they have imparted potency but when as in the case of\\nnicholas the czar the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an\\nimperial brain then the plebeian herds crouch abased before the\\ntremendous centralization nor will the tragic dramatist who would\\ndepict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing\\never forget a hint incidentally so important in his art as the one\\nnow alluded to\\n\\nbut ahab my captain still moves before me in all his nantucket\\ngrimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperors and\\nkings i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old\\nwhalehunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings\\nand housings are denied me oh ahab what shall be grand in thee it\\nmust needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep and\\nfeatured in the unbodied air\\n\\n\\nchapter 34 the cabintable\\n\\nit is noon and doughboy the steward thrusting his pale\\nloafofbread face from the cabinscuttle announces dinner to his lord\\nand master who sitting in the lee quarterboat has just been taking\\nan observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on\\nthe smooth medallionshaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on\\nthe upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to the\\ntidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but\\npresently catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to the\\ndeck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying dinner mr\\nstarbuck disappears into the cabin\\n\\nwhen the last echo of his sultans step has died away and starbuck\\nthe first emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated then\\nstarbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along the planks\\nand after a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch of\\npleasantness dinner mr stubb and descends the scuttle the second\\nemir lounges about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the\\nmain brace to see whether it will be all right with that important\\nrope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid dinner\\nmr flask follows after his predecessors\\n\\nbut the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarterdeck\\nseems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all\\nsorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off his\\nshoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right\\nover the grand turks head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching\\nhis cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goes down rollicking so\\nfar at least as he remains visible from the deck reversing all other\\nprocessions by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping into\\nthe cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and\\nthen independent hilarious little flask enters king ahabs presence\\nin the character of abjectus or the slave\\n\\nit is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\\nartificialness of seausages that while in the open air of the deck\\nsome officers will upon provocation bear themselves boldly and\\ndefyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those\\nvery officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that\\nsame commanders cabin and straightway their inoffensive not to say\\ndeprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of the\\ntable this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this\\ndifference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of\\nbabylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously\\ntherein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur but he\\nwho in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own\\nprivate dinnertable of invited guests that mans unchallenged power\\nand dominion of individual influence for the time that mans royalty\\nof state transcends belshazzars for belshazzar was not the greatest\\nwho has but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be cæsar\\nit is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding\\nnow if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a\\nshipmaster then by inference you will derive the cause of that\\npeculiarity of sealife just mentioned\\n\\nover his ivoryinlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned sealion\\non the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still\\ndeferential cubs in his own proper turn each officer waited to be\\nserved they were as little children before ahab and yet in ahab\\nthere seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind\\ntheir intent eyes all fastened upon the old mans knife as he carved\\nthe chief dish before him i do not suppose that for the world they\\nwould have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even\\nupon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reaching out his\\nknife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahab\\nthereby motioned starbucks plate towards him the mate received his\\nmeat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little\\nstarted if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed\\nit noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for like\\nthe coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperor\\nprofoundly dines with the seven imperial electors so these cabin meals\\nwere somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old\\nahab forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb what a relief\\nit was to choking stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold\\nbelow and poor little flask he was the youngest son and little boy\\nof this weary family party his were the shinbones of the saline beef\\nhis would have been the drumsticks for flask to have presumed to help\\nhimself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the\\nfirst degree had he helped himself at that table doubtless never\\nmore would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world\\nnevertheless strange to say ahab never forbade him and had flask\\nhelped himself the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it\\nleast of all did flask presume to help himself to butter whether he\\nthought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account of its\\nclotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so\\nlong a voyage in such marketless waters butter was at a premium and\\ntherefore was not for him a subaltern however it was flask alas\\nwas a butterless man\\n\\nanother thing flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask\\nis the first man up consider for hereby flasks dinner was badly\\njammed in point of time starbuck and stubb both had the start of him\\nand yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear if stubb\\neven who is but a peg higher than flask happens to have but a small\\nappetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then flask\\nmust bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that\\nday for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the\\ndeck therefore it was that flask once admitted in private that ever\\nsince he had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment he\\nhad never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry more or less\\nfor what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortal\\nin him peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed\\nfrom my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i could fish a bit of\\noldfashioned beef in the forecastle as i used to when i was before\\nthe mast theres the fruits of promotion now theres the vanity of\\nglory theres the insanity of life besides if it were so that any\\nmere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flasks\\nofficial capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample\\nvengeance was to go aft at dinnertime and get a peep at flask\\nthrough the cabin skylight sitting silly and dumfoundered before\\nawful ahab\\n\\nnow ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table\\nin the pequods cabin after their departure taking place in inverted\\norder to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was\\nrestored to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then the\\nthree harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being its residuary\\nlegatees they made a sort of temporary servants hall of the high and\\nmighty cabin\\n\\nin strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\\ninvisible domineerings of the captains table was the entire carefree\\nlicense and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior\\nfellows the harpooneers while their masters the mates seemed afraid\\nof the sound of the hinges of their own jaws the harpooneers chewed\\ntheir food with such a relish that there was a report to it they dined\\nlike lords they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading\\nwith spices such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego that\\nto fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast often the pale\\ndoughboy was fain to bring on a great baron of saltjunk seemingly\\nquarried out of the solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he\\ndid not go with a nimble hopskipandjump then tashtego had an\\nungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back\\nharpoonwise and once daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted\\ndoughboys memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head\\ninto a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand\\nbegan laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him he was\\nnaturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow this\\nbreadfaced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital\\nnurse and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab\\nand the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages\\ndoughboys whole life was one continual lipquiver commonly after\\nseeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded he\\nwould escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining and\\nfearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door till all was\\nover\\n\\nit was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego opposing\\nhis filed teeth to the indians crosswise to them daggoo seated on\\nthe floor for a bench would have brought his hearseplumed head to the\\nlow carlines at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low\\ncabin framework to shake as when an african elephant goes passenger in\\na ship but for all this the great negro was wonderfully abstemious\\nnot to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\\nsmall mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so\\nbroad baronial and superb a person but doubtless this noble savage\\nfed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through\\nhis dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds not by\\nbeef or by bread are giants made or nourished but queequeg he had a\\nmortal barbaric smack of the lip in eatingan ugly sound enoughso\\nmuch so that the trembling doughboy almost looked to see whether any\\nmarks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms and when he would hear\\ntashtego singing out for him to produce himself that his bones might\\nbe picked the simplewitted steward all but shattered the crockery\\nhanging round him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy nor\\ndid the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for\\ntheir lances and other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner\\nthey would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that grating sound did\\nnot at all tend to tranquillize poor doughboy how could he forget\\nthat in his island days queequeg for one must certainly have been\\nguilty of some murderous convivial indiscretions alas doughboy\\nhard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals not a napkin\\nshould he carry on his arm but a buckler in good time though to his\\ngreat delight the three saltsea warriors would rise and depart to\\nhis credulous fablemongering ears all their martial bones jingling\\nin them at every step like moorish scimetars in scabbards\\n\\nbut though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominally lived\\nthere still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were\\nscarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and just before sleepingtime\\nwhen they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters\\n\\nin this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most american whale\\ncaptains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights\\nthe ships cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that\\nanybody else is at any time permitted there so that in real truth\\nthe mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to\\nhave lived out of the cabin than in it for when they did enter it it\\nwas something as a streetdoor enters a house turning inwards for a\\nmoment only to be turned out the next and as a permanent thing\\nresiding in the open air nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin\\nwas no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible though nominally\\nincluded in the census of christendom he was still an alien to it he\\nlived in the world as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled\\nmissouri and as when spring and summer had departed that wild logan\\nof the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the\\nwinter there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old\\nage ahabs soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed\\nupon the sullen paws of its gloom\\n\\n\\nchapter 35 the masthead\\n\\nit was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the\\nother seamen my first masthead came round\\n\\nin most american whalemen the

a three four or five years voyage she\\nis drawing nigh home with anything empty in hersay an empty vial\\neventhen her mastheads are kept manned to the last and not till her\\nskysailpoles sail in among the spires of the port does she altogether\\nrelinquish the hope of capturing one whale more\\n\\nnow as the business of standing mastheads ashore or afloat is a\\nvery ancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiate\\nhere i take it that the earliest standers of mastheads were the old\\negyptians because in all my researches i find none prior to them\\nfor though their progenitors the builders of babel must doubtless by\\ntheir tower have intended to rear the loftiest masthead in all asia\\nor africa either yet ere the final truck was put to it as that great\\nstone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the\\ndread gale of gods wrath therefore we cannot give these babel\\nbuilders priority over the egyptians and that the egyptians were a\\nnation of masthead standers is an assertion based upon the general\\nbelief among archæologists that the first pyramids were founded for\\nastronomical purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar\\nstairlike formation of all four sides of those edifices whereby with\\nprodigious long upliftings of their legs those old astronomers were\\nwont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars even as the\\nlookouts of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing\\nin sight in saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old times\\nwho built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole\\nlatter portion of his life on its summit hoisting his food from the\\nground with a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a\\ndauntless standerofmastheads who was not to be driven from his\\nplace by fogs or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiantly facing\\neverything out to the last literally died at his post of modern\\nstandersofmastheads we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron\\nand bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff gale\\nare still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\\ndiscovering any strange sight there is napoleon who upon the top of\\nthe column of vendome stands with arms folded some one hundred and\\nfifty feet in the air careless now who rules the decks below\\nwhether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil great\\nwashington too stands high aloft on his towering mainmast in\\nbaltimore and like one of hercules pillars his column marks that\\npoint of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go admiral\\nnelson also on a capstan of gunmetal stands his masthead in\\ntrafalgar square and ever when most obscured by that london smoke\\ntoken is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there is\\nsmoke must be fire but neither great washington nor napoleon nor\\nnelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to\\nbefriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze\\nhowever it may be surmised that their spirits penetrate through the\\nthick haze of the future and descry what shoals and what rocks must be\\nshunned\\n\\nit may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the masthead\\nstanders of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not\\nso is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy the sole\\nhistorian of nantucket stands accountable the worthy obed tells us\\nthat in the early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly\\nlaunched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erected\\nlofty spars along the seacoast to which the lookouts ascended by\\nmeans of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a henhouse\\na few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new\\nzealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the readymanned\\nboats nigh the beach but this custom has now become obsolete turn we\\nthen to the one proper masthead that of a whaleship at sea the\\nthree mastheads are kept manned from sunrise to sunset the seamen\\ntaking their regular turns as at the helm and relieving each other\\nevery two hours in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly\\npleasant the masthead nay to a dreamy meditative man it is\\ndelightful there you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks\\nstriding along the deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while\\nbeneath you and between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters\\nof the sea even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous\\ncolossus at old rhodes there you stand lost in the infinite series of\\nthe sea with nothing ruffled but the waves the tranced ship\\nindolently rolls the drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you\\ninto languor for the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime\\nuneventfulness invests you you hear no news read no gazettes extras\\nwith startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into\\nunnecessary excitements you hear of no domestic afflictions bankrupt\\nsecurities fall of stocks are never troubled with the thought of what\\nyou shall have for dinnerfor all your meals for three years and more\\nare snugly stowed in casks and your bill of fare is immutable\\n\\nin one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four years\\nvoyage as often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the\\nmasthead would amount to several entire months and it is much to be\\ndeplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion\\nof the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute of\\nanything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted to breed a\\ncomfortable localness of feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock\\na hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small\\nand snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves your\\nmost usual point of perch is the head of the t gallantmast where you\\nstand upon two thin parallel sticks almost peculiar to whalemen\\ncalled the t gallant crosstrees here tossed about by the sea the\\nbeginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bulls horns to\\nbe sure in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in\\nthe shape of a watchcoat but properly speaking the thickest\\nwatchcoat is no more of a house than the unclad body for as the soul\\nis glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle and cannot freely move about\\nin it nor even move out of it without running great risk of perishing\\nlike an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in winter so a\\nwatchcoat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope or\\nadditional skin encasing you you cannot put a shelf or chest of\\ndrawers in your body and no more can you make a convenient closet of\\nyour watchcoat\\n\\nconcerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mastheads of a\\nsouthern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or\\npulpits called _crowsnests_ in which the lookouts of a greenland\\nwhaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas in\\nthe fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among the\\nicebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the\\nrediscovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland in this\\nadmirable volume all standers of mastheads are furnished with a\\ncharmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\\n_crowsnest_ of the glacier which was the name of captain sleets\\ngood craft he called it the _sleets crowsnest_ in honor of\\nhimself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from all\\nridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children\\nafter our own names we fathers being the original inventors and\\npatentees so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other\\napparatus we may beget in shape the sleets crowsnest is something\\nlike a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is\\nfurnished with a movable sidescreen to keep to windward of your head\\nin a hard gale being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into\\nit through a little traphatch in the bottom on the after side or\\nside next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker\\nunderneath for umbrellas comforters and coats in front is a leather\\nrack in which to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope and\\nother nautical conveniences when captain sleet in person stood his\\nmasthead in this crowsnest of his he tells us that he always had a\\nrifle with him also fixed in the rack together with a powder flask\\nand shot for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales or\\nvagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters for you cannot\\nsuccessfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the\\nwater but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing now it\\nwas plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe as he does\\nall the little detailed conveniences of his crowsnest but though he\\nso enlarges upon many of these and though he treats us to a very\\nscientific account of his experiments in this crowsnest with a small\\ncompass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors\\nresulting from what is called the local attraction of all binnacle\\nmagnets an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in\\nthe ships planks and in the glaciers case perhaps to there having\\nbeen so many brokendown blacksmiths among her crew i say that though\\nthe captain is very discreet and scientific here yet for all his\\nlearned binnacle deviations azimuth compass observations and\\napproximate errors he knows very well captain sleet that he was\\nnot so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations as to fail\\nbeing attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little\\ncasebottle so nicely tucked in on one side of his crows nest within\\neasy reach of his hand though upon the whole i greatly admire and\\neven love the brave the honest and learned captain yet i take it\\nvery ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that casebottle\\nseeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been while\\nwith mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics\\naloft there in that birds nest within three or four perches of the\\npole\\n\\nbut if we southern whalefishers are not so snugly housed aloft as\\ncaptain sleet and his greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is\\ngreatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\\nseductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float for one i used\\nto lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a\\nchat with queequeg or any one else off duty whom i might find there\\nthen ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the\\ntopsail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and so\\nat last mount to my ultimate destination\\n\\nlet me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i kept\\nbut sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolving in me how\\ncould ibeing left completely to myself at such a thoughtengendering\\naltitudehow could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all\\nwhaleships standing orders keep your weather eye open and sing out\\nevery time\\n\\nand let me in this place movingly admonish you ye shipowners of\\nnantucket beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with\\nlean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and who\\noffers to ship with the phædon instead of bowditch in his head beware\\nof such an one i say your whales must be seen before they can be\\nkilled and this sunkeneyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes\\nround the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer nor\\nare these monitions at all unneeded for nowadays the whalefishery\\nfurnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absentminded\\nyoung men disgusted with the carking cares of earth and seeking\\nsentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently perches\\nhimself upon the masthead of some luckless disappointed whaleship\\nand in moody phrase ejaculates\\n\\n\\nroll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll ten thousand\\nblubberhunters sweep over thee in vain\\n\\n\\n\\nvery often do the captains of such ships take those absentminded young\\nphilosophers to task upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient\\ninterest in the voyage halfhinting that they are so hopelessly lost\\nto all honorable ambition as that in their secret souls they would\\nrather not see whales than otherwise but all in vain those young\\nplatonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect they are\\nshortsighted what use then to strain the visual nerve they have\\nleft their operaglasses at home\\n\\nwhy thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lads weve been\\ncruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whale\\nyet whales are scarce as hens teeth whenever thou art up here\\nperhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in\\nthe far horizon but lulled into such an opiumlike listlessness of\\nvacant unconscious reverie is this absentminded youth by the blending\\ncadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses his identity\\ntakes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep\\nblue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every strange\\nhalfseen gliding beautiful thing that eludes him every\\ndimlydiscovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to him\\nthe embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by\\ncontinually flitting through it in this enchanted mood thy spirit\\nebbs away to whence it came becomes diffused through time and space\\nlike cranmers sprinkled pantheistic ashes forming at last a part of\\nevery shore the round globe over\\n\\nthere is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by a\\ngently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from\\nthe inscrutable tides of god but while this sleep this dream is on\\nye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your\\nidentity comes back in horror over descartian vortices you hover and\\nperhaps at midday in the fairest weather with one halfthrottled\\nshriek you drop through that

of the pipe that one morning\\nshortly after breakfast ahab as was his wont ascended the\\ncabingangway to the deck there most seacaptains usually walk at that\\nhour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns in\\nthe garden\\n\\nsoon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old\\nrounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all over\\ndented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk did\\nyou fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also\\nyou would see still stranger footprintsthe footprints of his one\\nunsleeping everpacing thought\\n\\nbut on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even as his\\nnervous step that morning left a deeper mark and so full of his\\nthought was ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the\\nmainmast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought\\nturn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely\\npossessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of\\nevery outer movement\\n\\ndye mark him flask whispered stubb the chick thats in him pecks\\nthe shell twill soon be out\\n\\nthe hours wore onahab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the\\ndeck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect\\n\\nit drew near the close of day suddenly he came to a halt by the\\nbulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the augerhole there and\\nwith one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuck to send everybody\\naft\\n\\nsir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on\\nshipboard except in some extraordinary case\\n\\nsend everybody aft repeated ahab mastheads there come down\\n\\nwhen the entire ships company were assembled and with curious and not\\nwholly unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlike\\nthe weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidly\\nglancing over the bulwarks and then darting his eyes among the crew\\nstarted from his standpoint and as though not a soul were nigh him\\nresumed his heavy turns upon the deck with bent head and halfslouched\\nhat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among\\nthe men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have\\nsummoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat\\nbut this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried\\n\\nwhat do ye do when ye see a whale men\\n\\nsing out for him was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed\\nvoices\\n\\ngood cried ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing the\\nhearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically\\nthrown them\\n\\nand what do ye next men\\n\\nlower away and after him\\n\\nand what tune is it ye pull to men\\n\\na dead whale or a stove boat\\n\\nmore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the\\ncountenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began to\\ngaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they\\nthemselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions\\n\\nbut they were all eagerness again as ahab now halfrevolving in his\\npivothole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly\\nalmost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus\\n\\nall ye mastheaders have before now heard me give orders about a white\\nwhale look ye dye see this spanish ounce of goldholding up a\\nbroad bright coin to the sunit is a sixteen dollar piece men dye\\nsee it mr starbuck hand me yon topmaul\\n\\nwhile the mate was getting the hammer ahab without speaking was\\nslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if\\nto heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowly\\nhumming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and\\ninarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his\\nvitality in him\\n\\nreceiving the topmaul from starbuck he advanced towards the mainmast\\nwith the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the\\nother and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye raises\\nme a whiteheaded whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw\\nwhosoever of ye raises me that whiteheaded whale with three holes\\npunctured in his starboard flukelook ye whosoever of ye raises me\\nthat same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys\\n\\nhuzza huzza cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins they\\nhailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast\\n\\nits a white whale i say resumed ahab as he threw down the\\ntopmaul a white whale skin your eyes for him men look sharp for\\nwhite water if ye see but a bubble sing out\\n\\nall this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg had looked on with even\\nmore intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention of\\nthe wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was\\nseparately touched by some specific recollection\\n\\ncaptain ahab said tashtego that white whale must be the same that\\nsome call moby dick\\n\\nmoby dick shouted ahab do ye know the white whale then tash\\n\\ndoes he fantail a little curious sir before he

starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far\\nbeen eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed\\nstruck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder captain\\nahab i have heard of moby dickbut it was not moby dick that took off\\nthy leg\\n\\nwho told thee that cried ahab then pausing aye starbuck aye my\\nhearties all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that\\nbrought me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shouted\\nwith a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heartstricken moose\\naye aye it was that accursed white whale that razed me made a poor\\npegging lubber of me for ever and a day then tossing both arms with\\nmeasureless imprecations he shouted out aye aye and ill chase him\\nround good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom\\nand round perditions flames before i give him up and this is what ye\\nhave shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land\\nand over all sides of earth till he

mine with greedy ears i learned the history of that murderous\\nmonster against whom i and all the others had taken our oaths of\\nviolence and revenge\\n\\nfor some time past though at intervals only the unaccompanied\\nsecluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly\\nfrequented by the sperm whale fishermen but not all of them knew of\\nhis existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seen\\nhim while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given\\nbattle to him was small indeed for owing to the large number of\\nwhalecruisers the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire\\nwatery circumference many of them adventurously pushing their quest\\nalong solitary latitudes so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth\\nor more on a stretch to encounter a single newstelling sail of any\\nsort the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity\\nof the times of sailing from home all these with other circumstances\\ndirect and indirect long obstructed the spread through the whole\\nworldwide whalingfleet of the special individualizing tidings\\nconcerning moby dick it was hardly to be doubted that several vessels\\nreported to have encountered at such or such a time or on such or\\nsuch a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity\\nwhich whale after doing great mischief to his assailants had\\ncompletely escaped them to some minds it was not an unfair\\npresumption i say that the whale in question must have been no other\\nthan moby dick yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked\\nby various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity cunning and\\nmalice in the monster attacked therefore it was that those who by\\naccident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick such hunters perhaps\\nfor the most part were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred\\nmore as it were to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large\\nthan to the individual cause in that way mostly the disastrous\\nencounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly\\nregarded\\n\\nand as for those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance\\ncaught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one\\nof them almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him as for any\\nother whale of that species but at length such calamities did ensue\\nin these assaultsnot restricted to sprained wrists and ankles broken\\nlimbs or devouring amputationsbut fatal to the last degree of\\nfatality those repeated disastrous repulses all accumulating and\\npiling their terrors upon moby dick those things had gone far to shake\\nthe fortitude of many brave hunters to whom the story of the white\\nwhale had eventually come\\n\\nnor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the more\\nhorrify the true histories of these deadly encounters for not only do\\nfabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising\\nterrible eventsas the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi but in\\nmaritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumors\\nabound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to\\nand as the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery\\nsurpasses every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and\\nfearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there for not only\\nare whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and\\nsuperstitiousness hereditary to all sailors but of all sailors they\\nare by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is\\nappallingly astonishing in the sea face to face they not only eye its\\ngreatest marvels but hand to jaw give battle to them alone in such\\nremotest waters that though you sailed a thousand miles and passed a\\nthousand shores you would not come to any chiseled hearthstone or\\naught hospitable beneath that part of the sun in such latitudes and\\nlongitudes pursuing too such a calling as he does the whaleman is\\nwrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many\\na mighty birth\\n\\nno wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over\\nthe widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the white whale did in\\nthe end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and\\nhalfformed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies which\\neventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything\\nthat visibly appears so that in many cases such a panic did he finally\\nstrike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the white\\nwhale few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his\\njaw\\n\\nbut there were still other and more vital practical influences at work\\nnot even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm\\nwhale as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\\nleviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body there are\\nthose this day among them who though intelligent and courageous\\nenough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale would\\nperhapseither from professional inexperience or incompetency or\\ntimidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there\\nare plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nations not\\nsailing under the american flag who have never hostilely encountered\\nthe sperm whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is\\nrestricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north\\nseated on their hatches these men will hearken with a childish\\nfireside interest and awe to the wild strange tales of southern\\nwhaling nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale\\nanywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prows\\nwhich stem him\\n\\nand as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\\ntimes thrown its shadow before it we find some book\\nnaturalistsolassen and povelsondeclaring the sperm whale not only to\\nbe a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be\\nso incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood\\nnor even down to so late a time as cuviers were these or almost\\nsimilar impressions effaced for in his natural history the baron\\nhimself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale all fish sharks\\nincluded are struck with the most lively terrors and often in the\\nprecipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with\\nsuch violence as to cause instantaneous death and however the general\\nexperiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these yet in\\ntheir full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson the\\nsuperstitious belief in them is in some vicissitudes of their\\nvocation revived in the minds of the hunters\\n\\nso that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him not a few\\nof the fishermen recalled in reference to moby dick the earlier days\\nof the sperm whale fishery when it was oftentimes hard to induce long\\npractised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring\\nwarfare such men protesting that although other leviathans might be\\nhopefully pursued yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition\\nas the sperm whale was not for mortal man that to attempt it would be\\ninevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this head there are\\nsome remarkable documents that may be consulted\\n\\nnevertheless some there were who even in the face of these things\\nwere ready to give chase to moby dick and a still greater number who\\nchancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without the\\nspecific details of any certain calamity and without superstitious\\naccompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if\\noffered\\n\\none of the wild suggestions referred to as at last coming to be linked\\nwith the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined was\\nthe unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous that he had\\nactually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same\\ninstant of time\\n\\nnor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceit\\naltogether without some faint show of superstitious probability for as\\nthe secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged\\neven to the most erudite research so the hidden ways of the sperm\\nwhale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to\\nhis pursuers and from time to time have originated the most curious\\nand contradictory speculations regarding them especially concerning\\nthe mystic modes whereby after sounding to a great depth he\\ntransports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant\\npoints\\n\\nit is a thing well known to both american and english whaleships and\\nas well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby\\nthat some whales have been captured far north in the pacific in whose\\nbodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland\\nseas nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instances it has\\nbeen declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could\\nnot have exceeded very many days hence by inference it has been\\nbelieved by some whalemen that the nor west passage so long a\\nproblem to man was never a problem to the whale so that here in the\\nreal living experience of living men the prodigies related in old\\ntimes of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there\\nwas said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the\\nsurface and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain\\nnear syracuse whose waters were believed to have come from the holy\\nland by an underground passage these fabulous narrations are almost\\nfully equalled by the realities of the whalemen\\n\\nforced into familiarity then with such prodigies as these and\\nknowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the white whale had\\nescaped alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen\\nshould go still further in their superstitions declaring moby dick not\\nonly ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity in\\ntime that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks he\\nwould still swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to\\nspout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for\\nagain in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsullied\\njet would once more be seen\\n\\nbut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough in\\nthe earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike\\nthe imagination with unwonted power for it was not so much his\\nuncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales\\nbut as was elsewhere thrown outa peculiar snowwhite wrinkled\\nforehead and a high pyramidical white hump these were his prominent\\nfeatures the tokens whereby even in the limitless uncharted seas he\\nrevealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him\\n\\nthe rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the\\nsame shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive\\nappellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justified by\\nhis vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue\\nsea leaving a milkyway wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden\\ngleamings\\n\\nnor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his\\ndeformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural\\nterror as that unexampled intelligent malignity which according to\\nspecific accounts he had over and over again evinced in his assaults\\nmore than all his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than\\nperhaps aught else for when swimming before his exulting pursuers\\nwith every apparent symptom of alarm he had several times been known\\nto turn round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave their\\nboats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship\\n\\nalready several fatalities had attended his chase but though similar\\ndisasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual in\\nthe fishery yet in most instances such seemed the white whales\\ninfernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death\\nthat he caused was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an\\nunintelligent agent\\n\\njudge then to what pitches of inflamed distracted fury the minds of\\nhis more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips of chewed\\nboats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the\\nwhite curds of the whales direful wrath into the serene exasperating\\nsunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal\\n\\nhis three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling in the\\neddies one captain seizing the lineknife from his broken prow had\\ndashed at the whale as an arkansas duellist at his foe blindly\\nseeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathomdeep life of the\\nwhale that captain was ahab and then it was that suddenly sweeping\\nhis sickleshaped lower jaw beneath him moby dick had reaped away\\nahabs leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field no turbaned turk\\nno hired venetian or malay could have smote him with more seeming\\nmalice small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that\\nalmost fatal encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness\\nagainst the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness\\nhe at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but\\nall his intellectual and spiritual exasperations the white whale swam\\nbefore him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious\\nagencies which some deep men feel eating in them till they are left\\nliving on with half a heart and half a lung that intangible malignity\\nwhich has been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern\\nchristians ascribe onehalf of the worlds which the ancient ophites of\\nthe east reverenced in their statue devilahab did not fall down and\\nworship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the\\nabhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it all\\nthat most maddens and torments all that stirs up the lees of things\\nall truth with malice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\\nbrain all the subtle demonisms of life and thought all evil to crazy\\nahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in moby\\ndick he piled upon the whales white hump the sum of all the general\\nrage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down and then as if\\nhis chest had been a mortar he burst his hot hearts shell upon it\\n\\nit is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at\\nthe precise time of his bodily dismemberment then in darting at the\\nmonster knife in hand he had but given loose to a sudden passionate\\ncorporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he\\nprobably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more\\nyet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and for long\\nmonths of days and weeks ahab and anguish lay stretched together in\\none hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagonian\\ncape then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one\\nanother and so interfusing made him mad that it was only then on\\nthe homeward voyage after the encounter that the final monomania\\nseized him seems all but certain from the fact that at intervals\\nduring the passage he was a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of a\\nleg yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and was\\nmoreover intensified by his delirium that his mates were forced to\\nlace him fast even there as he sailed raving in his hammock in a\\nstraitjacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gales and when\\nrunning into more sufferable latitudes the ship with mild stunsails\\nspread floated across the tranquil tropics and to all appearances\\nthe old mans delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn\\nswells and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and\\nair even then when he bore that firm collected front however pale\\nand issued his calm orders once again and his mates thanked god the\\ndireful madness was now gone even then ahab in his hidden self\\nraved on human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing\\nwhen you think it fled it may have but become transfigured into some\\nstill subtler form ahabs full lunacy subsided not but deepeningly\\ncontracted like the unabated hudson when that noble northman flows\\nnarrowly but unfathomably through the highland gorge but as in his\\nnarrowflowing monomania not one jot of ahabs broad madness had been\\nleft behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his great natural\\nintellect had perished that before living agent now became the living\\ninstrument if such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy\\nstormed his general sanity and carried it and turned all its\\nconcentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that far from having lost\\nhis strength ahab to that one end did now possess a thousand fold\\nmore potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one\\nreasonable object\\n\\nthis is much yet ahabs larger darker deeper part remains unhinted\\nbut vain to popularize profundities and all truth is profound winding\\nfar down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where\\nwe here standhowever grand and wonderful now quit itand take your\\nway ye nobler sadder souls to those vast roman halls of thermes\\nwhere far beneath the fantastic towers of mans upper earth his root\\nof grandeur his whole awful essence sits in bearded state an

entablatures of\\nages wind ye down there ye prouder sadder souls question that\\nproud sad king a family likeness aye he did beget ye ye young\\nexiled royalties and from your grim sire only will the old\\nstatesecret come\\n\\nnow in his heart ahab had some glimpse of this namely all my means\\nare sane my motive and my object mad yet without power to kill or\\nchange or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankind he did long\\ndissemble in some sort did still but that thing of his dissembling\\nwas only subject to his perceptibility not to his will determinate\\nnevertheless so well did he succeed in that dissembling that when\\nwith ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no nantucketer thought him\\notherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the\\nterrible casualty which had overtaken him\\n\\nthe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\\nascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the added moodiness which\\nalways afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the\\npresent voyage sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikely\\nthat far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage on\\naccount of such dark symptoms the calculating people of that prudent\\nisle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasons\\nhe was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full\\nof rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales gnawed within and\\nscorched without with the infixed unrelenting fangs of some incurable\\nidea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart\\nhis iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes\\nor if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that\\nyet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on\\nhis underlings to the attack but be all this as it may certain it is\\nthat with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in\\nhim ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one\\nonly and allengrossing object of hunting the white whale had any one\\nof his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking\\nin him then how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have\\nwrenched the ship from such a fiendish man they were bent on\\nprofitable cruises the profit to be counted down in dollars from the\\nmint he was intent on an audacious immitigable and supernatural\\nrevenge\\n\\nhere then was this greyheaded ungodly old man chasing with curses\\na jobs whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly made\\nup of mongrel renegades and castaways and cannibalsmorally enfeebled\\nalso by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or rightmindedness in\\nstarbuck the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in\\nstubb and the pervading mediocrity in flask such a crew so\\nofficered seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality\\nto help him to his monomaniac revenge how it was that they so\\naboundingly responded to the old mans ireby what evil magic their\\nsouls were possessed that at times his hate seemed almost theirs the\\nwhite whale as much their insufferable foe as

he\\nwas to me as yet remains unsaid\\n\\naside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick which\\ncould not but occasionally awaken in any mans soul some alarm there\\nwas another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning him\\nwhich at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest\\nand yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it that i almost\\ndespair of putting it in a comprehensible form it was the whiteness of\\nthe whale that above all things appalled me but how can i hope to\\nexplain myself here and yet in some dim random way explain myself i\\nmust else all these chapters might be naught\\n\\nthough in many natural objects whiteness refiningly enhances beauty\\nas if imparting some special virtue of its own as in marbles\\njaponicas and pearls and though various nations have in some way\\nrecognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric\\ngrand old kings of pegu placing the title lord of the white elephants\\nabove all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion and the\\nmodern kings of siam unfurling the same snowwhite quadruped in the\\nroyal standard and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a\\nsnowwhite charger and the great austrian empire cæsarian heir to\\noverlording rome having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue\\nand though this preeminence in it applies to the human race itself\\ngiving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and\\nthough besides all this whiteness has been even made significant of\\ngladness for among the romans a white stone marked a joyful day and\\nthough in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings this same hue is\\nmade the emblem of many touching noble thingsthe innocence of brides\\nthe benignity of age though among the red men of america the giving of\\nthe white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor though in\\nmany climes whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of\\nthe judge and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn\\nby milkwhite steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the most\\naugust religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness\\nand power by the persian fire worshippers the white forked flame\\nbeing held the holiest on the altar and in the greek mythologies\\ngreat jove himself being made incarnate in a snowwhite bull and\\nthough to the noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred\\nwhite dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology that\\nspotless faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send\\nto the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity and\\nthough directly from the latin word for white all christian priests\\nderive the name of one part of their sacred vesture the alb or tunic\\nworn beneath the cassock and though among the holy pomps of the romish\\nfaith white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of\\nour lord though in the vision of st john white robes are given to\\nthe redeemed and the fourandtwenty elders stand clothed in white\\nbefore the great white throne and the holy one that sitteth there\\nwhite like wool yet for all these accumulated associations with\\nwhatever is sweet and honorable and sublime there yet lurks an\\nelusive something in the innermost idea of this hue which strikes more\\nof panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood\\n\\nthis elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness when\\ndivorced from more kindly associations and coupled with any object\\nterrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds\\nwitness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of the\\ntropics what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them the\\ntranscendent horrors they are that ghastly whiteness it is which\\nimparts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific\\nto the dumb gloating of their aspect so that not the fiercefanged\\ntiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the whiteshrouded\\nbear or shark\\n\\nwith reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by him who\\nwould fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not the\\nwhiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable\\nhideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened hideousness\\nit might be said only rises from the circumstance that the\\nirresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the\\nfleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringing together\\ntwo such opposite emotions in our minds the polar bear frightens us\\nwith so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be true\\nyet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified\\nterror\\n\\nas for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that\\ncreature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallies with the\\nsame quality in the polar quadruped this peculiarity is most vividly\\nhit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish the romish\\nmass for the dead begins with requiem eternam eternal rest whence\\n_requiem_ denominating the mass itself and any other funeral music\\nnow in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark\\nand the mild deadliness of his habits the french call him _requin_\\n\\nbethink thee of the albatross whence come those clouds of spiritual\\nwonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sails in all\\nimaginations not coleridge first threw that spell but gods great\\nunflattering laureate nature\\n\\ni remember the first albatross i ever saw it was during a prolonged\\ngale in waters hard upon the antarctic seas from my forenoon watch\\nbelow i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the\\nmain hatches i saw a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and\\nwith a hooked roman bill sublime at intervals it arched forth its\\nvast archangel wings as if to embrace some holy ark wondrous\\nflutterings and throbbings shook it though bodily unharmed it uttered\\ncries as some kings ghost in supernatural distress through its\\ninexpressible strange eyes methought i peeped to secrets which took\\nhold of god as abraham before the angels i bowed myself the white\\nthing was so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiled\\nwaters i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of\\ntowns long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage i cannot tell can only\\nhint the things that darted through me then but at last i awoke and\\nturning asked a sailor what bird was this a goney he replied goney\\nnever had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious\\nthing is utterly unknown to men ashore never but some time after i\\nlearned that goney was some seamans name for albatross so that by no\\npossibility could coleridges wild rhyme have had aught to do with\\nthose mystical impressions which were mine when i saw that bird upon\\nour deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor knew the bird to\\nbe an albatross yet in saying this i do but indirectly burnish a\\nlittle brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet\\n\\ni assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird\\nchiefly lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced in\\nthis that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey\\nalbatrosses and these i have frequently seen but never with such\\nemotions as when i beheld the antarctic fowl\\n\\nbut how had the mystic thing been caught whisper it not and i will\\ntell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl floated on the sea\\nat last the captain made a postman of it tying a lettered leathern\\ntally round its neck with the ships time and place and then letting\\nit escape but i doubt not that leathern tally meant for man was\\ntaken off in heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wingfolding\\nthe invoking and adoring cherubim\\n\\nmost famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of the\\nwhite steed of the prairies a magnificent milkwhite charger\\nlargeeyed smallheaded bluffchested and with the dignity of a\\nthousand monarchs in his lofty overscorning carriage he was the\\nelected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in those\\ndays were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies at\\ntheir flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which\\nevery evening leads on the hosts of light the flashing cascade of his\\nmane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housings more\\nresplendent than gold and silverbeaters could have furnished him a\\nmost imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western\\nworld which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the\\nglories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god\\nbluffbrowed and fearless as this mighty steed whether marching amid\\nhis aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly\\nstreamed it over the plains like an ohio or whether with his\\ncircumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon the white\\nsteed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through\\nhis cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presented himself always to\\nthe bravest indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe\\nnor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this\\nnoble horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which so\\nclothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in it\\nwhich though commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain\\nnameless terror\\n\\nbut there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that\\naccessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed and\\nalbatross\\n\\nwhat is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks\\nthe eye as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin it is\\nthat whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the name he\\nbears the albino is as well made as other menhas no substantive\\ndeformityand yet this mere aspect of allpervading whiteness makes him\\nmore strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion why should this be\\nso\\n\\nnor in quite other aspects does nature in her least palpable but not\\nthe less malicious agencies fail to enlist among her forces this\\ncrowning attribute of the terrible from its snowy aspect the\\ngauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white\\nsquall nor in some historic instances has the art of human malice\\nomitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the effect of\\nthat passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their\\nfaction the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the\\nmarketplace\\n\\nnor in some things does the common hereditary experience of all\\nmankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue it\\ncannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect of\\nthe dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering\\nthere as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of\\nconsternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here and\\nfrom that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of the\\nshroud in which we wrap them nor even in our superstitions do we fail\\nto throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts rising in\\na milkwhite fogyea while these terrors seize us let us add that\\neven the king of terrors when personified by the evangelist rides on\\nhis pallid horse\\n\\ntherefore in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or gracious\\nthing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in its profoundest\\nidealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul\\n\\nbut though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man to\\naccount for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then by\\nthe citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of\\nwhitenessthough for the time either wholly or in great part stripped\\nof all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful\\nbut nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery however\\nmodifiedcan we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us\\nto the hidden cause we seek\\n\\nlet us try but in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtlety\\nand without imagination no man can follow another into these halls and\\nthough doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressions about\\nto be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps were\\nentirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be able\\nto recall them now\\n\\nwhy to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but loosely\\nacquainted with the peculiar character of the day does the bare\\nmention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary\\nspeechless processions of slowpacing pilgrims downcast and hooded\\nwith newfallen snow or to the unread unsophisticated protestant of\\nthe middle american states why does the passing mention of a white\\nfriar or a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul\\n\\nor what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and\\nkings which will not wholly account for it that makes the white tower\\nof london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an\\nuntravelled american than those other storied structures its\\nneighborsthe byward tower or even the bloody and those sublimer\\ntowers the white mountains of new hampshire whence in peculiar\\nmoods comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare\\nmention of that name while the thought of virginias blue ridge is\\nfull of a soft dewy distant dreaminess or why irrespective of all\\nlatitudes and longitudes does the name of the white sea exert such a\\nspectralness over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lulls us with\\nmortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves\\nfollowed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets or to choose a\\nwholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why in\\nreading the old fairy tales of central europe does the tall pale man\\nof the hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides\\nthrough the green of the groveswhy is this phantom more terrible than\\nall the whooping imps of the blocksburg\\n\\nnor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedraltoppling\\nearthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas nor the\\ntearlessness of arid skies that never rain nor the sight of her wide\\nfield of leaning spires wrenched copestones and crosses all adroop\\nlike canted yards of anchored fleets and her suburban avenues of\\nhousewalls lying over upon each other as a tossed pack of cardsit\\nis not these things alone which make tearless lima the strangest\\nsaddest city thou canst see for lima has taken the white veil and\\nthere is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old as pizarro\\nthis whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerful\\ngreenness of complete decay spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid\\npallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions\\n\\ni know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness\\nis not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of\\nobjects otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is there\\naught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind\\nalmost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when\\nexhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or\\nuniversality what i mean by these two statements may perhaps be\\nrespectively elucidated by the following examples\\n\\nfirst the mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands if\\nby night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and feels\\njust enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but under\\nprecisely similar circumstances let him be called from his hammock to\\nview his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whitenessas if\\nfrom encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming\\nround him then he feels a silent superstitious dread the shrouded\\nphantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost in\\nvain the lead assures him he is still off soundings heart and helm\\nthey both go down he never rests till blue water is under him again\\nyet where is the mariner who will tell thee sir it was not so much\\nthe fear of striking hidden rocks as the fear of that hideous\\nwhiteness that so stirred me\\n\\nsecond to the native indian of peru the continual sight of the\\nsnowhowdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the\\nmere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast\\naltitudes and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to\\nlose oneself in such inhuman solitudes much the same is it with the\\nbackwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference views an\\nunbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig\\nto break the fixed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholding\\nthe scenery of the antarctic seas where at times by some infernal\\ntrick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air he shivering and\\nhalf shipwrecked instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his\\nmisery views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with\\nits lean ice monuments and splintered crosses\\n\\nbut thou sayest methinks that whitelead chapter about whiteness is\\nbut a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a\\nhypo ishmael\\n\\ntell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of\\nvermont far removed from all beasts of preywhy is it that upon the\\nsunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that\\nhe cannot even see it but only smells its wild animal muskinesswhy\\nwill he start snort and with bursting eyes paw the ground in\\nphrensies of affright there is no remembrance in him of any gorings of\\nwild creatures in his green northern home so that the strange\\nmuskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the\\nexperience of former perils for what knows he this new england colt\\nof the black bisons of distant oregon\\n\\nno but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the\\nknowledge of the demonism in the world though thousands of miles from\\noregon still when he smells that savage musk the rending goring\\nbison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the\\nprairies which this instant they may be trampling into dust\\n\\nthus then the muffled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings of\\nthe festooned frosts of mountains the desolate shiftings of the\\nwindrowed snows of prairies all these to ishmael are as the shaking\\nof that buffalo robe to the frightened colt\\n\\nthough neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic\\nsign gives forth such hints yet with me as with the colt somewhere\\nthose things must exist though in many of its aspects this visible\\nworld seems formed in love the invisible spheres were formed in\\nfright\\n\\nbut not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and\\nlearned why it appeals with such power to the soul and more strange\\nand far more portentouswhy as we have seen it is at once the most\\nmeaning symbol of spiritual things nay the very veil of the\\nchristians deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agent\\nin things the most appalling to mankind\\n\\nis it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids\\nand immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind with the\\nthought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the milky\\nway or is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as\\nthe visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all\\ncolours is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness\\nfull of meaning in a wide landscape of snowsa colourless allcolour\\nof atheism from which we shrink and when we consider that other theory\\nof the natural philosophers that all other earthly huesevery stately\\nor lovely emblazoningthe sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea\\nand the gilded velvets of butterflies and the butterfly cheeks of\\nyoung girls all these are but subtile deceits not actually inherent\\nin substances but only laid on from without so that all deified\\nnature absolutely paints like the harlot whose allurements cover\\nnothing but the charnelhouse within and when we proceed further and\\nconsider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her\\nhues the great principle of light for ever remains white or colorless\\nin itself and if operating without medium upon matter would touch all\\nobjects even tulips and roses with its own blank tingepondering all\\nthis the palsied universe lies before us a leper and like wilful\\ntravellers in lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring\\nglasses upon their eyes so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at\\nthe monumental white shroud that

the night succeeding that wild ratification of his\\npurpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the\\ntransom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea\\ncharts spread them before him on his screweddown table then seating\\nhimself before it you would have seen him intently study the various\\nlines and shadings which there met his eye and with slow but steady\\npencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank at\\nintervals he would refer to piles of old logbooks beside him wherein\\nwere set down the seasons and places in which on various former\\nvoyages of various ships sperm whales had been captured or seen\\n\\nwhile thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his\\nhead continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for ever\\nthrew shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow till\\nit almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and\\ncourses on the wrinkled charts some invisible pencil was also tracing\\nlines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead\\n\\nbut it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of his\\ncabin ahab thus pondered over his charts almost every night they were\\nbrought out almost every night some pencil marks were effaced and\\nothers were substituted for with the charts of all four oceans before\\nhim ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies with a view to\\nthe more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul\\n\\nnow to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans\\nit might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\\ncreature in the unhooped oceans of this planet but not so did it seem\\nto ahab who knew the sets of all tides and currents and thereby\\ncalculating the driftings of the sperm whales food and also calling\\nto mind the regular ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular\\nlatitudes could arrive at reasonable surmises almost approaching to\\ncertainties concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that\\nground in search of his prey\\n\\nso assured indeed is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\\nsperm whales resorting to given waters that many hunters believe\\nthat could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world\\nwere the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\\ncollated then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to\\ncorrespond in invariability to those of the herringshoals or the\\nflights of swallows on this hint attempts have been made to construct\\nelaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale\\n\\n\\n  since the above was written the statement is happily borne out by\\n  an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of the national\\n  observatory washington april 16th 1851 by that circular it\\n  appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion and\\n  portions of it are presented in the circular this chart divides the\\n  ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of\\n  longitude perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve\\n  columns for the twelve months and horizontally through each of which\\n  districts are three lines one to show the number of days that have\\n  been spent in each month in every district and the two others to\\n  show the number of days in which whales sperm or right have been\\n  seen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbesides when making a passage from one feedingground to another the\\nsperm whales guided by some infallible instinctsay rather secret\\nintelligence from the deitymostly swim in _veins_ as they are called\\ncontinuing their way along a given oceanline with such undeviating\\nexactitude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with one\\ntithe of such marvellous precision though in these cases the\\ndirection taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyors parallel\\nand though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own\\nunavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary _vein_ in which at these\\ntimes he is said to swim generally embraces some few miles in width\\nmore or less as the vein is presumed to expand or contract but\\nnever exceeds the visual sweep from the whaleships mastheads when\\ncircumspectly gliding along this magic zone the sum is that at\\nparticular seasons within that breadth and along that path migrating\\nwhales may with great confidence be looked for\\n\\nand hence not only at substantiated times upon well known separate\\nfeedinggrounds could ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossing\\nthe widest expanses of water between those grounds he could by his\\nart so place and time himself on his way as even then not to be\\nwholly without prospect of a meeting\\n\\nthere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\\ndelirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality\\nperhaps though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons\\nfor particular grounds yet in general you cannot conclude that the\\nherds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year\\nsay will turn out to be identically the same with those that were\\nfound there the preceding season though there are peculiar and\\nunquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true in\\ngeneral the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the\\nsolitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales so that\\nthough moby dick had in a former year been seen for example on what\\nis called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on\\nthe japanese coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to\\nvisit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season she\\nwould infallibly encounter him there so too with some other feeding\\ngrounds where he had at times revealed himself but all these seemed\\nonly his casual stoppingplaces and oceaninns so to speak not his\\nplaces of prolonged abode and where ahabs chances of accomplishing\\nhis object have hitherto been spoken of allusion has only been made to\\nwhatever wayside antecedent extra prospects were his ere a\\nparticular set time or place were attained when all possibilities\\nwould become probabilities and as ahab fondly thought every\\npossibility the next thing to a certainty that particular set time and\\nplace were conjoined in the one technical phrasethe\\nseasonontheline for there and then for several consecutive years\\nmoby dick had been periodically descried lingering in those waters for\\nawhile as the sun in its annual round loiters for a predicted\\ninterval in any one sign of the zodiac there it was too that most of\\nthe deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place there the\\nwaves were storied with his deeds there also was that tragic spot\\nwhere the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his\\nvengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering\\nvigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering\\nhunt he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one\\ncrowning fact above mentioned however flattering it might be to those\\nhopes nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\\nunquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest\\n\\nnow the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the\\nseasonontheline no possible endeavor then could enable her\\ncommander to make the great passage southwards double cape horn and\\nthen running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\\npacific in time to cruise there therefore he must wait for the next\\nensuing season yet the premature hour of the pequods sailing had\\nperhaps been correctly selected by ahab with a view to this very\\ncomplexion of things because an interval of three hundred and\\nsixtyfive days and nights was before him an interval which instead\\nof impatiently enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt\\nif by chance the white whale spending his vacation in seas far remote\\nfrom his periodical feedinggrounds should turn up his wrinkled brow\\noff the persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in any\\nother waters haunted by his race so that monsoons pampas\\nnorwesters harmattans trades any wind but the levanter and simoon\\nmight blow moby dick into the devious zigzag worldcircle of the\\npequods circumnavigating wake\\n\\nbut granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it\\nnot but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one\\nsolitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of\\nindividual recognition from his hunter even as a whitebearded mufti\\nin the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople yes for the peculiar\\nsnowwhite brow of moby dick and his snowwhite hump could not but be\\nunmistakable and have i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter to\\nhimself as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he\\nwould throw himself back in reveriestallied him and shall he escape\\nhis broad fins are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheeps ear\\nand here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a\\nweariness and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air\\nof the deck he would seek to recover his strength ah god what\\ntrances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one\\nunachieved revengeful desire he sleeps with clenched hands and wakes\\nwith his own bloody nails in his palms\\n\\noften when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid\\ndreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughts through\\nthe day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them\\nround and round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing\\nof his lifespot became insufferable anguish and when as was\\nsometimes the case these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up\\nfrom its base and a chasm seemed opening in him from which forked\\nflames and lightnings shot up and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap\\ndown among them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wild\\ncry would be heard through the ship and with glaring eyes ahab would\\nburst from his state room as though escaping from a bed that was on\\nfire yet these perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms\\nof some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were but the\\nplainest tokens of its intensity for at such times crazy ahab the\\nscheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab\\nthat had gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him to\\nburst from it in horror again the latter was the eternal living\\nprinciple or soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociated\\nfrom the characterizing mind which at other times employed it for its\\nouter vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the\\nscorching contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time it\\nwas no longer an integral but as the mind does not exist unless\\nleagued with the soul therefore it must have been that in ahabs\\ncase yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme\\npurpose that purpose by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced\\nitself against gods and devils into a kind of selfassumed independent\\nbeing of its own nay could grimly live and burn while the common\\nvitality to which it was conjoined fled horrorstricken from the\\nunbidden and unfathered birth therefore the tormented spirit that\\nglared out of bodily eyes when what seemed ahab rushed from his room\\nwas for the time but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being\\na ray of living

indeed\\nas indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious\\nparticulars in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter in\\nits earlier part is as important a one as will be found in this\\nvolume but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and\\nmore familiarly enlarged upon in order to be adequately understood\\nand moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of\\nthe entire subject may induce in some minds as to the natural verity\\nof the main points of this affair\\n\\ni care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall be\\ncontent to produce the desired impression by separate citations of\\nitems practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and from\\nthese citations i take itthe conclusion aimed at will naturally\\nfollow of itself\\n\\nfirst i have personally known three instances where a whale after\\nreceiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after an\\ninterval in one instance of three years has been again struck by the\\nsame hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same\\nprivate cypher have been taken from the body in the instance where\\nthree years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons and i\\nthink it may have been something more than that the man who darted\\nthem happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to\\nafrica went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated far\\ninto the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two years\\noften endangered by serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas with\\nall the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of\\nunknown regions meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have been\\non its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe\\nbrushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa but to no purpose\\nthis man and this whale again came together and the one vanquished the\\nother i say i myself have known three instances similar to this\\nthat is in two of them i saw the whales struck and upon the second\\nattack saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them\\nafterwards taken from the dead fish in the threeyear instance it so\\nfell out that i was in the boat both times first and last and the\\nlast time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the\\nwhales eye which i had observed there three years previous i say\\nthree years but i am pretty sure it was more than that here are three\\ninstances then which i personally know the truth of but i have heard\\nof many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there\\nis no good ground to impeach\\n\\nsecondly it is well known in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant\\nthe world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorable\\nhistorical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at\\ndistant times and places popularly cognisable why such a whale became\\nthus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily\\npeculiarities as distinguished from other whales for however peculiar\\nin that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his\\npeculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly\\nvaluable oil no the reason was this that from the fatal experiences\\nof the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about\\nsuch a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that most\\nfishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their\\ntarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea\\nwithout seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance like some\\npoor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man they\\nmake distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if they\\npursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump\\nfor their presumption\\n\\nbut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual\\ncelebritynay you may call it an oceanwide renown not only was he\\nfamous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death\\nbut he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinctions\\nof a name had as much a name indeed as cambyses or cæsar was it not\\nso o timor tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so\\nlong didst lurk in the oriental straits of that name whose spout was\\noft seen from the palmy beach of ombay was it not so o new zealand\\njack thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the\\nvicinity of the tattoo land was it not so o morquan king of japan\\nwhose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snowwhite\\ncross against the sky was it not so o don miguel thou chilian whale\\nmarked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back in\\nplain prose here are four whales as well known to the students of\\ncetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar\\n\\nbut this is not all new zealand tom and don miguel after at various\\ntimes creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels were\\nfinally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and killed\\nby valiant whaling captains who heaved up their anchors with that\\nexpress object as much in view as in setting out through the\\nnarragansett woods captain butler of old had it in his mind to capture\\nthat notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of the\\nindian king philip\\n\\ni do not know where i can find a better place than just here to make\\nmention of one or two other things which to me seem important as in\\nprinted form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the\\nwhole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for\\nthis is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full\\nas much bolstering as error so ignorant are most landsmen of some of\\nthe plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that without some\\nhints touching the plain facts historical and otherwise of the\\nfishery they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or still\\nworse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory\\n\\nfirst though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general\\nperils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vivid\\nconception of those perils and the frequency with which they recur\\none reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actual disasters\\nand deaths by casualties in the fishery ever finds a public record at\\nhome however transient and immediately forgotten that record do you\\nsuppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by\\nthe whaleline off the coast of new guinea is being carried down to\\nthe bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathando you suppose that\\nthat poor fellows name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will\\nread tomorrow at your breakfast no because the mails are very\\nirregular between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear what\\nmight be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea yet i\\ntell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific\\namong many others we spoke thirty different ships every one of which\\nhad had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that\\nhad each lost a boats crew for gods sake be economical with your\\nlamps and candles not a gallon you burn but at least one drop of\\nmans blood was spilled for it\\n\\nsecondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale\\nis an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever found that\\nwhen narrating to them some specific example of this twofold\\nenormousness they have significantly complimented me upon my\\nfacetiousness when i declare upon my soul i had no more idea of\\nbeing facetious than moses when he wrote the history of the plagues of\\negypt\\n\\nbut fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon\\ntestimony entirely independent of my own that point is this the sperm\\nwhale is in some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously\\nmalicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy\\nand sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale _has_ done it\\n\\nfirst in the year 1820 the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket\\nwas cruising in the pacific ocean one day she saw spouts lowered her\\nboats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales ere long several of\\nthe whales were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping\\nfrom the boats issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon the\\nship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove her in that\\nin less than ten minutes she settled down and fell over not a\\nsurviving plank of her has been seen since after the severest\\nexposure part of the crew reached the land in their boats being\\nreturned home at last captain pollard once more sailed for the pacific\\nin command of another ship but the gods shipwrecked him again upon\\nunknown rocks and breakers for the second time his ship was utterly\\nlost and forthwith forswearing the sea he has never tempted it since\\nat this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket i have seen\\nowen chace who was chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy\\ni have read his plain and faithful narrative i have conversed with his\\nson and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe\\n\\nthe following are extracts from chaces narrative every fact seemed\\nto warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which\\ndirected his operations he made two several attacks upon the ship at\\na short interval between them both of which according to their\\ndirection were calculated to do us the most injury by being made\\nahead and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the\\nshock to effect which the exact manœuvres which he made were\\nnecessary his aspect was most horrible and such as indicated\\nresentment and fury he came directly from the shoal which we had just\\nbefore entered and in which we had struck three of his companions as\\nif fired with revenge for their sufferings again at all events the\\nwhole circumstances taken together all happening before my own eyes\\nand producing at the time impressions in my mind of decided\\ncalculating mischief on the part of the whale many of which\\nimpressions i cannot now recall induce me to be satisfied that i am\\ncorrect in my opinion\\n\\nhere are his reflections some time after quitting the ship during a\\nblack night in an open boat when almost despairing of reaching any\\nhospitable shore the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing the\\nfears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed upon\\nhidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful\\ncontemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moments thought the\\ndismal looking wreck and _the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale_\\nwholly engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance\\n\\nin another placep 45he speaks of _the mysterious and mortal attack\\nof the animal_\\n\\nsecondly the ship union also of nantucket was in the year 1807\\ntotally lost off the azores by a similar onset but the authentic\\nparticulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter\\nthough from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casual\\nallusions to it\\n\\nthirdly some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j then\\ncommanding an american sloopofwar of the first class happened to be\\ndining with a party of whaling captains on board a nantucket ship in\\nthe harbor of oahu sandwich islands conversation turning upon whales\\nthe commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength\\nascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present he peremptorily\\ndenied for example that any whale could so smite his stout\\nsloopofwar as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful very\\ngood but there is more coming some weeks after the commodore set\\nsail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso but he was stopped on\\nthe way by a portly sperm whale that begged a few moments\\nconfidential business with him that business consisted in fetching the\\ncommodores craft such a thwack that with all his pumps going he made\\nstraight for the nearest port to heave down and repair i am not\\nsuperstitious but i consider the commodores interview with that whale\\nas providential was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a\\nsimilar fright i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense\\n\\ni will now refer you to langsdorffs voyages for a little circumstance\\nin point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof langsdorff you\\nmust know by the way was attached to the russian admiral krusensterns\\nfamous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century\\ncaptain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter\\n\\nby the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail and the next day\\nwe were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh the weather was\\nvery clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to\\nkeep on our fur clothing for some days we had very little wind it was\\nnot till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up\\nan uncommon large whale the body of which was larger than the ship\\nitself lay almost at the surface of the water but was not perceived\\nby any one on board till the moment when the ship which was in full\\nsail was almost upon him so that it was impossible to prevent its\\nstriking against him we were thus placed in the most imminent danger\\nas this gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship three\\nfeet at least out of the water the masts reeled and the sails fell\\naltogether while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck\\nconcluding that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we saw\\nthe monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity captain\\ndwolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the\\nvessel had received any damage from the shock but we found that very\\nhappily it had escaped entirely uninjured\\n\\nnow the captain dwolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\\nquestion is a new englander who after a long life of unusual\\nadventures as a seacaptain this day resides in the village of\\ndorchester near boston i have the honor of being a nephew of his i\\nhave particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff\\nhe substantiates every word the ship however was by no means a large\\none a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchased by my\\nuncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home\\n\\nin that up and down manly book of oldfashioned adventure so full\\ntoo of honest wondersthe voyage of lionel wafer one of ancient\\ndampiers old chumsi found a little matter set down so like that just\\nquoted from langsdorff that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a\\ncorroborative example if such be needed\\n\\nlionel it seems was on his way to john ferdinando as he calls the\\nmodern juan fernandes in our way thither he says about four\\noclock in the morning when we were about one hundred and fifty\\nleagues from the main of america our ship felt a terrible shock which\\nput our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where\\nthey were or what to think but every one began to prepare for death\\nand indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for\\ngranted the ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement was\\na little over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground  \\n   the suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their\\ncarriages and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks\\ncaptain davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrown out of his\\ncabin lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake and\\nseems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great\\nearthquake somewhere about that time did actually do great mischief\\nalong the spanish land but i should not much wonder if in the\\ndarkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was after all\\ncaused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath\\n\\ni might proceed with several more examples one way or another known to\\nme of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale in more\\nthan one instance he has been known not only to chase the assailing\\nboats back to their ships but to pursue the ship itself and long\\nwithstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks the english ship\\npusie hall can tell a story on that head and as for his strength let\\nme say that there have been examples where the lines attached to a\\nrunning sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and\\nsecured there the whale towing her great hull through the water as a\\nhorse walks off with a cart again it is very often observed that if\\nthe sperm whale once struck is allowed time to rally he then acts\\nnot so often with blind rage as with wilful deliberate designs of\\ndestruction to his pursuers nor is it without conveying some eloquent\\nindication of his character that upon being attacked he will\\nfrequently open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for\\nseveral consecutive minutes but i must be content with only one more\\nand a concluding illustration a remarkable and most significant one\\nby which you will not fail to see that not only is the most marvellous\\nevent in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day but\\nthat these marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages\\nso that for the millionth time we say amen with solomonverily there is\\nnothing new under the sun\\n\\nin the sixth christian century lived procopius a christian magistrate\\nof constantinople in the days when justinian was emperor and\\nbelisarius general as many know he wrote the history of his own\\ntimes a work every way of uncommon value by the best authorities he\\nhas always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating\\nhistorian except in some one or two particulars not at all affecting\\nthe matter presently to be mentioned\\n\\nnow in this history of his procopius mentions that during the term\\nof his prefecture at constantinople a great seamonster was captured\\nin the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyed\\nvessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty\\nyears a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be\\ngainsaid nor is there any reason it should be of what precise species\\nthis seamonster was is not mentioned but as he destroyed ships as\\nwell as for other reasons he must have been a whale and i am strongly\\ninclined to think a sperm whale and i will tell you why for a long\\ntime i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the\\nmediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it even now i am\\ncertain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in the\\npresent constitution of things a place for his habitual gregarious\\nresort but further investigations have recently proved to me that in\\nmodern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the\\nsperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that on\\nthe barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy found the\\nskeleton of a sperm whale now as a vessel of war readily passes\\nthrough the dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route\\npass out of the mediterranean into the propontis\\n\\nin the propontis as far as i can learn none of that peculiar\\nsubstance called _brit_ is to be found the aliment of the right whale\\nbut i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\\nwhalesquid or cuttlefishlurks at the bottom of that sea because\\nlarge creatures but by no means the largest of that sort have been\\nfound at its surface if then you properly put these statements\\ntogether and reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that\\naccording to all human reasoning procopiuss seamonster that for\\nhalf a century stove the ships of a roman emperor must in all\\nprobability have been a sperm whale\\n\\n\\nchapter 46 surmises\\n\\nthough consumed with the hot fire of his purpose ahab in all his\\nthoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby\\ndick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that\\none passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and\\nlong habituation far too wedded to a fiery whalemans ways altogether\\nto abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage or at least if\\nthis were otherwise there were not wanting other motives much more\\ninfluential with him it would be refining too much perhaps even\\nconsidering his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the\\nwhite whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all\\nsperm whales and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he\\nmultiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would\\nprove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis be\\nindeed exceptionable there were still additional considerations which\\nthough not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling\\npassion yet were by no means incapable of swaying him\\n\\nto accomplish his object ahab must use tools and of all tools used in\\nthe shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knew\\nfor example that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was\\nover starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual\\nman any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual\\nmastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in\\na sort of corporeal relation starbucks body and starbucks coerced\\nwill were ahabs so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbucks brain\\nstill he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred\\nhis captains quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself\\nfrom it or even frustrate it it might be that a long interval would\\nelapse ere the white whale was seen during that long interval starbuck\\nwould ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\\ncaptains leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial\\ninfluences were brought to bear upon him not only that but the subtle\\ninsanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly\\nmanifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing\\nthat for the present the hunt should in some way be stripped of that\\nstrange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it that the\\nfull terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\\nbackground for few mens courage is proof against protracted\\nmeditation unrelieved by action that when they stood their long night\\nwatches his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of\\nthan moby dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had\\nhailed the announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are\\nmore or less capricious and unreliablethey live in the varying outer\\nweather and they inhale its ficklenessand when retained for any\\nobject remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and\\npassion in the end it is above all things requisite that temporary\\ninterests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily\\nsuspended for the final dash\\n\\nnor was ahab unmindful of another thing in times of strong emotion\\nmankind disdain all base considerations but such times are evanescent\\nthe permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought\\nahab is sordidness granting that the white whale fully incites the\\nhearts of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even\\nbreeds a certain generous knighterrantism in them still while for\\nthe love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have food\\nfor their more common daily appetites for even the high lifted and\\nchivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two\\nthousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre without\\ncommitting burglaries picking pockets and gaining other pious\\nperquisites by the way had they been strictly held to their one final\\nand romantic objectthat final and romantic object too many would have\\nturned from in disgust i will not strip these men thought ahab of\\nall hopes of cashaye cash they may scorn cash now but let some\\nmonths go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this\\nsame quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would\\nsoon cashier ahab\\n\\nnor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related\\nto ahab personally having impulsively it is probable and perhaps\\nsomewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the\\npequods voyage ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing he\\nhad indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of\\nusurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crew\\nif so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further\\nobedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command from\\neven the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possible\\nconsequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab must\\nof course have been most anxious to protect himself that protection\\ncould only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand\\nbacked by a heedful closely calculating attention to every minute\\natmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be\\nsubjected to\\n\\nfor all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be\\nverbally developed here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good\\ndegree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequods\\nvoyage observe all customary usages and not only that but force\\nhimself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general\\npursuit of his profession\\n\\nbe all this as it may his voice was now often heard hailing the three\\nmastheads and admonishing them to keep a bright lookout and not omit\\nreporting even a porpoise this vigilance was not long without reward\\n\\n\\nchapter 47 the matmaker\\n\\nit was a cloudy sultry afternoon the seamen were lazily lounging\\nabout the decks or vacantly gazing over into the leadcoloured waters\\nqueequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what

at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took\\nevery eye from the whale with a start all glared at dark ahab who was\\nsurrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air\\n\\n\\nchapter 48 the first lowering\\n\\nthe phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side\\nof the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the\\ntackles and bands of the boat which swung there this boat had always\\nbeen deemed one of the spare boats though technically called the\\ncaptains on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter the\\nfigure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white\\ntooth evilly protruding from its steellike lips a rumpled chinese\\njacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black\\ntrowsers of the same dark stuff but strangely crowning this ebonness\\nwas a glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and\\ncoiled round and round upon his head less swart in aspect the\\ncompanions of this figure were of that vivid tigeryellow complexion\\npeculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the manillasa race\\nnotorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white\\nmariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents\\non the water of the devil their lord whose countingroom they suppose\\nto be elsewhere\\n\\nwhile yet the wondering ships company were gazing upon these\\nstrangers ahab cried out to the whiteturbaned old man at their head\\nall ready there fedallah\\n\\nready was the halfhissed reply\\n\\nlower away then dye hear shouting across the deck lower away\\nthere i say\\n\\nsuch was the thunder of his voice that spite of their amazement the\\nmen sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks with\\na wallow the three boats dropped into the sea while with a\\ndexterous offhanded daring unknown in any other vocation the\\nsailors goatlike leaped down the rolling ships side into the tossed\\nboats below\\n\\nhardly had they pulled out from under the ships lee when a fourth\\nkeel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and\\nshowed the five strangers rowing

but you must not suppose from this\\nspecimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions\\nwith his congregation not at all and therein consisted his chief\\npeculiarity he would say the most terrific things to his crew in a\\ntone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed so\\ncalculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear\\nsuch queer invocations without pulling for dear life and yet pulling\\nfor the mere joke of the thing besides he all the time looked so easy\\nand indolent himself so loungingly managed his steeringoar and

right give way men\\nit aint the white whale today give way\\n\\nnow the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant\\nas the lowering of the boats from the deck this had not unreasonably\\nawakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ships\\ncompany but archys fancied discovery having some time previous got\\nabroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in some\\nsmall measure prepared them for the event it took off the extreme edge\\nof their wonder and so what with all this and stubbs confident way of\\naccounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from\\nsuperstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room\\nfor all manner of wild conjectures as to dark ahabs precise agency in\\nthe matter from the beginning for me i silently recalled the\\nmysterious shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the\\ndim nantucket dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of the\\nunaccountable elijah\\n\\nmeantime ahab out of hearing of his officers having sided the\\nfurthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats a\\ncircumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him those tiger\\nyellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five\\ntriphammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength which\\nperiodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst\\nboiler out of a mississippi steamer as for fedallah who was seen\\npulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and\\ndisplayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the\\ngunwale clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery\\nhorizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a\\nfencers thrown half backward into the air as if to counterbalance\\nany tendency to trip ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar\\nas in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him all\\nat once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained\\nfixed while the boats five oars were seen simultaneously peaked boat\\nand crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three spread boats in\\nthe rear paused on their way the whales had irregularly settled bodily\\ndown into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the\\nmovement though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it\\n\\nevery man look out along his oars cried starbuck thou queequeg\\nstand up\\n\\nnimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the savage\\nstood erect there and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the\\nspot where the chase had last been descried likewise upon the extreme\\nstern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with\\nthe gunwale starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing\\nhimself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently\\neyeing the vast blue eye of the sea\\n\\nnot very far distant flasks boat was also lying breathlessly still\\nits commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a\\nstout sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet above\\nthe level of the stern platform it is used for catching turns with the\\nwhale line its top is not more spacious than the palm of a mans hand\\nand standing upon such a base as that flask seemed perched at the\\nmasthead of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks but little\\nkingpost was small and short and at the same time little kingpost\\nwas full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead\\nstandpoint of his did by no means satisfy kingpost\\n\\ni cant see three seas off tip us up an oar there and let me on to\\nthat\\n\\nupon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way\\nswiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty\\nshoulders for a pedestal\\n\\ngood a masthead as any sir will you mount\\n\\nthat i will and thank ye very much my fine fellow only i wish you\\nfifty feet taller\\n\\nwhereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the\\nboat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palm to\\nflasks foot and then putting flasks hand on his hearseplumed head\\nand bidding him spring as he himself should toss with one dexterous\\nfling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders and here was\\nflask now standing daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a\\nbreastband to lean against and steady himself by\\n\\nat any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous\\nhabitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect\\nposture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotously\\nperverse and crossrunning seas still more strange to see him giddily\\nperched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances but the\\nsight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more\\ncurious for sustaining himself with a cool indifferent easy\\nunthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the\\nsea harmoniously rolled his fine form on his broad back flaxenhaired\\nflask seemed a snowflake the bearer looked nobler than the rider\\nthough truly vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little flask would now\\nand then stamp with impatience but not one added heave did he thereby\\ngive to the negros lordly chest so have i seen passion and vanity\\nstamping the living magnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her\\ntides and her seasons for that\\n\\nmeanwhile stubb the third mate betrayed no such fargazing\\nsolicitudes the whales might have made one of their regular soundings\\nnot a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case\\nstubb as his wont in such cases it seems was resolved to solace the\\nlanguishing interval with his pipe he withdrew it from his hatband\\nwhere he always wore it aslant like a feather he loaded it and rammed\\nhome the loading with his thumbend but hardly had he ignited his\\nmatch across the rough sandpaper of his hand when tashtego his\\nharpooneer whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed\\nstars suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat\\ncrying out in a quick phrensy of hurry down down all and give\\nwaythere they are\\n\\nto a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been\\nvisible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white\\nwater and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it and\\nsuffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white\\nrolling billows the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as it\\nwere like the air over intensely heated plates of iron beneath this\\natmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of\\nwater also the whales were swimming seen in advance of all the other\\nindications the puffs of vapor they spouted seemed their forerunning\\ncouriers and detached flying outriders\\n\\nall four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled\\nwater and air but it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and on as\\na mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the\\nhills\\n\\npull pull my good boys said starbuck in the lowest possible but\\nintensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixed glance\\nfrom his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as two\\nvisible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses he did not say much\\nto his crew though nor did his crew say anything to him only the\\nsilence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his\\npeculiar whispers now harsh with command now soft with entreaty\\n\\nhow different the loud little kingpost sing out and say

allusions of\\nflask to that whale as he called the fictitious monster which he\\ndeclared to be incessantly tantalizing his boats bow with its\\ntailthese allusions of his were at times so vivid and lifelike that\\nthey would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look\\nover the shoulder but this was against all rule for the oarsmen must\\nput out their eyes and ram a skewer

goadings to gain the\\ntop of the opposite hill the headlong sledlike slide down its other\\nsideall these with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers and\\nthe shuddering gasps of the oarsmen with the wondrous sight of the\\nivory pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails like\\na wild hen after her screaming broodall this was thrilling\\n\\nnot the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever\\nheat of his first battle not the dead mans ghost encountering the\\nfirst unknown phantom in the other worldneither of these can feel\\nstranger and stronger

separating their wakes\\nthe boats were pulled more apart starbuck giving chase to three whales\\nrunning dead to leeward our sail was now set and with the still\\nrising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through\\nthe water that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to\\nescape being torn from the rowlocks\\n\\nsoon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist neither\\nship nor boat to be seen\\n\\ngive way men whispered starbuck drawing still further aft the\\nsheet of his sail there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall\\ncomes theres

their eyes on the intense countenance\\nof the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the imminent\\ninstant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound as of\\nfifty elephants stirring in their litter meanwhile the boat was still\\nbooming through the mist the waves curling and hissing around us like\\nthe erected crests of enraged serpents\\n\\nthats his hump _there_ _there_ give it to him whispered\\nstarbuck\\n\\na short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it was the darted iron of\\nqueequeg then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from\\nastern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge the sail\\ncollapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by\\nsomething rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us the whole\\ncrew were half suffocated as they were tossed helterskelter into the\\nwhite curdling cream of the squall squall whale and harpoon had all\\nblended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped\\n\\nthough completely swamped the boat was nearly unharmed swimming round\\nit we picked up the floating oars and lashing them across the gunwale\\ntumbled back to our places there we sat up to our knees in the sea\\nthe water covering every rib and plank so that to our downward gazing\\neyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the\\nbottom of the ocean\\n\\nthe wind increased to a howl the waves dashed their bucklers together\\nthe whole squall roared forked and crackled around us like a white\\nfire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal\\nin these jaws of death in vain we hailed the other boats as well roar\\nto the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those\\nboats in that storm meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew\\ndarker with the shadows of night no sign of the ship could be seen\\nthe rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat the oars were\\nuseless as propellers performing now the office of lifepreservers\\nso cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many\\nfailures starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then\\nstretching it on a waif pole handed it to queequeg as the\\nstandardbearer of this forlorn hope there then he sat holding up\\nthat imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness there\\nthen he sat the sign and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly\\nholding up hope in the midst of despair\\n\\nwet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship or boat\\nwe lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on the mist still spread over\\nthe sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat\\nsuddenly queequeg started to his feet hollowing his hand to his ear\\nwe all heard a faint creaking as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled\\nby the storm the sound came nearer and nearer the thick mists were\\ndimly parted by a huge vague form affrighted we all sprang into the\\nsea as the ship at last loomed into view bearing right down upon us\\nwithin a distance of not much more than its length\\n\\nfloating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instant it\\ntossed and gaped beneath the ships bows like a chip at the base of a\\ncataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no\\nmore till it came up weltering astern again we swam for it were\\ndashed against it by the seas and were at last taken up and safely\\nlanded on board ere the squall came close to the other boats had cut\\nloose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time the ship\\nhad given us up but was still cruising if haply it might light upon\\nsome token of our perishingan oar or a lance pole\\n\\n\\nchapter 49 the hyena\\n\\nthere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange

buttoned up in his\\noiljacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain mr stubb i\\nthink i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief\\nmate mr starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent i suppose\\nthen that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy\\nsquall is the height of a whalemans discretion\\n\\ncertain ive lowered for whales from a

like to see a boats crew backing water up to a whale face\\nforemost ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind\\nthat\\n\\nhere then from three impartial witnesses i had a deliberate statement\\nof the entire case considering therefore that squalls and capsizings\\nin the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matters of\\ncommon occurrence in this kind of life considering that at the\\nsuperlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resign\\nmy life into the hands of him who steered the boatoftentimes a fellow\\nwho at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of\\nscuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that\\nthe particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be\\nimputed to starbucks driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a\\nsquall and considering that starbuck notwithstanding was famous for\\nhis great heedfulness in the fishery considering that i belonged to\\nthis

people it has often been argued whether considering\\nthe paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage it\\nis right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active\\nperils of the chase so tamerlanes soldiers often argued with tears in\\ntheir eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried\\ninto the thickest of the fight\\n\\nbut with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect considering that\\nwith two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger\\nconsidering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and\\nextraordinary difficulties that every individual moment indeed then\\ncomprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed\\nman to enter a whaleboat in the hunt as a general thing the\\njointowners of the pequod must have plainly thought not\\n\\nahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of\\nhis entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of\\nthe chase for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving\\nhis orders in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually\\napportioned to him as a regular headsman in the huntabove all for\\ncaptain ahab to be supplied with five extra men as that same boats\\ncrew he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads\\nof the owners of the pequod therefore he had not solicited a boats\\ncrew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head\\nnevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that\\nmatter until cabacos published discovery the sailors had little\\nforeseen it though to be sure when after being a little while out of\\nport all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the\\nwhaleboats for service when some time after this ahab was now and then\\nfound bestirring himself in the matter of making tholepins with his\\nown hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats and even\\nsolicitously cutting the small wooden skewers which when the line is\\nrunning out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this was\\nobserved in him and particularly his solicitude in having an extra\\ncoat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to make it better\\nwithstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety\\nhe evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat as it\\nis sometimes called the horizontal piece in the boats bow for bracing\\nthe knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale when it was\\nobserved how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee\\nfixed in the semicircular depression in the cleat and with the\\ncarpenters chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a\\nlittle there all these things i say had awakened much interest and\\ncuriosity at the time but almost everybody supposed that this\\nparticular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to\\nthe ultimate chase of moby dick for he had already revealed his\\nintention to hunt that mortal monster in person but such a supposition\\ndid by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boats crew\\nbeing assigned to that boat\\n\\nnow with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon waned\\naway for in a whaler wonders soon wane besides now and then such\\nunaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown\\nnooks and ashholes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of\\nwhalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway\\ncreatures found tossing about the open sea on planks bits of wreck\\noars whaleboats canoes blownoff japanese junks and what not that\\nbeelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin\\nto chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduable\\nexcitement in the forecastle\\n\\nbut be all this as it may certain it is that while the subordinate\\nphantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were\\nsomehow distinct from them yet that hairturbaned fedallah remained a\\nmuffled mystery to the last whence he came in a mannerly world like\\nthis by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be\\nlinked with ahabs peculiar fortunes nay so far as to have some sort\\nof a halfhinted influence heaven knows but it might have been even\\nauthority over him all this none knew but one cannot sustain an\\nindifferent air concerning fedallah he was such a creature as\\ncivilized domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their\\ndreams and that but dimly but the like of whom now and then glide\\namong the unchanging asiatic communities especially the oriental isles\\nto the east of the continentthose insulated immemorial unalterable\\ncountries which even in these modern days still preserve much of the\\nghostly aboriginalness of earths primal generations when the memory\\nof the first man was a distinct

by like scrolls of silver\\nand by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silvery\\nsilence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen\\nfar in advance of the white bubbles at the bow lit up by the moon it\\nlooked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from\\nthe sea fedallah first descried this jet for of these moonlight\\nnights it was his wont to mount to the mainmast head and stand a\\nlookout there with the same precision as if it had been day and yet\\nthough herds of whales were seen by night not one whaleman in a\\nhundred would venture a lowering for them you may think with what\\nemotions then the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft at\\nsuch unusual hours his turban and the moon companions in one sky but\\nwhen after spending his uniform interval there for several successive\\nnights without uttering a single sound when after all this silence\\nhis unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moonlit jet\\nevery reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit\\nhad lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew there she\\nblows had the trump of judgment blown they could not have quivered\\nmore yet still they felt no terror rather pleasure for though it was\\na most unwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and so deliriously\\nexciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a\\nlowering\\n\\nwalking the deck with quick sidelunging strides ahab commanded the\\ntgallant sails and royals to be set and every stunsail spread the\\nbest man in the ship must take the helm then with every masthead\\nmanned the piledup craft rolled down before the wind the strange\\nupheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows\\nof so many sails made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like air\\nbeneath the feet while still she rushed along as if two antagonistic\\ninfluences were struggling in herone to mount direct to heaven the\\nother to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watched\\nahabs face that night you would have thought that in him also two\\ndifferent things were warring while his one live leg made lively\\nechoes along the deck every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a\\ncoffintap on life and death this old man walked but though the ship\\nso swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager\\nglances shot yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night every\\nsailor swore he saw it once but not a second time\\n\\nthis midnightspout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some days\\nafter lo at the same silent hour it was again announced again it\\nwas descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more it\\ndisappeared as if it had never been and so it served us night after\\nnight till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously jetted\\ninto the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be\\ndisappearing again for one whole day or two days or three and\\nsomehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still\\nfurther and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever\\nalluring us on\\n\\nnor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance\\nwith the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many things invested\\nthe pequod were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that\\nwhenever and wherever descried at however remote times or in however\\nfar apart latitudes and longitudes that unnearable spout was cast by\\none selfsame whale and that whale moby dick for a time there\\nreigned too a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition as\\nif it were treacherously beckoning us on and on in order that the\\nmonster might turn round upon us and rend us at last in the remotest\\nand most savage seas\\n\\nthese temporary apprehensions so vague but so awful derived a\\nwondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in\\nwhich beneath all its blue blandness some thought there lurked a\\ndevilish charm as for days and days we voyaged along through seas so\\nwearily lonesomely mild that all space in repugnance to our vengeful\\nerrand seemed vacating itself of life before our urnlike prow\\n\\nbut at last when turning to the eastward the cape winds began\\nhowling around us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seas\\nthat are there when the ivorytusked pequod sharply bowed to the\\nblast and gored the dark waves in her madness till like showers of\\nsilver chips the foamflakes flew over her bulwarks then all this\\ndesolate vacuity of life went away but gave place to sights more\\ndismal than before\\n\\nclose to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and thither\\nbefore us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable searavens and\\nevery morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen and\\nspite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp\\nas though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft a\\nthing appointed to desolation and therefore fit roostingplace for\\ntheir homeless selves and heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved\\nthe black sea as if its vast tides were a conscience and the great\\nmundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering\\nit had bred\\n\\ncape of good hope do they call ye rather cape tormentoso as called\\nof yore for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had\\nattended us we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea where\\nguilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish seemed\\ncondemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat\\nthat black air without any horizon but calm snowwhite and\\nunvarying still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky still\\nbeckoning us on from before the solitary jet would at times be\\ndescried\\n\\nduring all this blackness of the elements ahab though assuming for\\nthe time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous\\ndeck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than ever\\naddressed his mates in tempestuous times like these after everything\\nabove and aloft has been secured nothing more can be done but\\npassively to await the issue of the gale then captain and crew become\\npractical fatalists so with his ivory leg inserted into its\\naccustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud ahab for\\nhours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward while an\\noccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very\\neyelashes together meantime the crew driven from the forward part of\\nthe ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows\\nstood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better to\\nguard against the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into a\\nsort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung as in a loosened\\nbelt few or no words were spoken and the silent ship as if manned by\\npainted sailors in wax day after day tore on through all the swift\\nmadness and gladness of the demoniac waves by night the same muteness\\nof humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still in silence\\nthe men swung in the bowlines still wordless ahab stood up to the\\nblast even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not\\nseek that repose in his hammock never could starbuck forget the old\\nmans aspect when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the\\nbarometer stood he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his\\nfloorscrewed chair the rain and halfmelted sleet of the storm from\\nwhich he had some time before emerged still slowly dripping from the\\nunremoved hat and coat on the table beside him lay unrolled one of\\nthose charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken\\nof his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand though the body\\nwas erect the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were\\npointed towards the needle of the telltale that swung from a beam in\\nthe ceiling\\n\\nthe cabincompass is called the telltale because without going to\\nthe compass at the helm the captain while below can inform himself\\nof the course of the ship\\n\\nterrible old man thought starbuck with a shudder sleeping in this\\ngale still thou steadfastly eyest thy

slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the\\nforemasthead i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro\\nin the far ocean fisheriesa whaler at sea and long absent from home\\n\\nas if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like the\\nskeleton of a stranded walrus all down her sides this spectral\\nappearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust while all\\nher spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred\\nover with hoarfrost only her lower sails were set a wild sight it\\nwas to see her longbearded lookouts at those three mastheads they\\nseemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the raiment\\nthat had survived nearly four years of cruising standing in iron hoops\\nnailed to the mast they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea and\\nthough when the ship slowly glided close under our stern we six men\\nin the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped\\nfrom the mastheads of one ship to those of the other yet those\\nforlornlooking fishermen mildly eyeing us as they passed said not\\none word to our own lookouts while the quarterdeck hail was being\\nheard from below\\n\\nship ahoy have ye seen the white whale\\n\\nbut as the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwarks was in\\nthe act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from his\\nhand into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove to\\nmake himself heard without it meantime his ship was still increasing\\nthe distance between while in various silent ways the seamen of the\\npequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the\\nfirst mere mention of the white whales name to another ship ahab for\\na moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a\\nboat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade but\\ntaking advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpet\\nand knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer\\nand shortly bound home he loudly hailedahoy there this is the\\npequod bound round the world tell them to address all future letters\\nto the pacific ocean and this time three years if i am not at home\\ntell them to address them to \\n\\nat that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed and instantly then\\nin accordance with their singular ways shoals of small harmless fish\\nthat for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side\\ndarted away with what seemed shuddering fins and ranged themselves\\nfore and aft with the strangers flanks though in the course of his\\ncontinual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar\\nsight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciously\\ncarry meanings\\n\\nswim away from me do ye murmured ahab gazing over into the water\\nthere seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyed more of\\ndeep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced\\nbut turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding the ship in\\nthe wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old lion\\nvoiceup helm keep her off round the world\\n\\nround the world there is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings\\nbut whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct only through\\nnumberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that\\nwe left behind secure were all the time before us\\n\\nwere this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we could for\\never reach new distances and discover sights more sweet and strange\\nthan any cyclades or islands of king solomon then there were promise\\nin the voyage but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or in\\ntormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swims\\nbefore all human hearts while chasing such over this round globe they\\neither lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed\\n\\n\\nchapter 53 the gam\\n\\nthe ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had\\nspoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms but even had this\\nnot been the case he would not after all perhaps have boarded\\nherjudging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasionsif so it had\\nbeen that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answer\\nto the question he put for as it eventually turned out he cared not\\nto consort even for five minutes with any stranger captain except he\\ncould contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought but\\nall this might remain inadequately estimated were not something said\\nhere of the peculiar usages of whalingvessels when meeting each other\\nin foreign seas and especially on a common cruisingground\\n\\nif two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state or the\\nequally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encountering\\neach other in such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life of\\nthem cannot well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for a moment\\nto interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for a while and\\nresting in concert then how much more natural that upon the\\nillimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea two whaling\\nvessels descrying each other at the ends of the earthoff lone\\nfannings island or the far away kings mills how much more natural\\ni say that under such circumstances these ships should not only\\ninterchange hails but come into still closer more friendly and\\nsociable contact and especially would this seem to be a matter of\\ncourse in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whose\\ncaptains officers and not a few of the men are personally known to\\neach other and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things to\\ntalk about\\n\\nfor the long absent ship the outwardbounder perhaps has letters on\\nboard at any rate she will be sure to let her have some papers of a\\ndate a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and\\nthumbworn files and in return for that courtesy the outwardbound\\nship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the\\ncruisingground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmost\\nimportance to her and in degree all this will hold true concerning\\nwhaling vessels crossing each others track on the cruisingground\\nitself even though they are equally long absent from home for one of\\nthem may have received a transfer of letters from some third and now\\nfar remote vessel and some of those letters may be for the people of\\nthe ship she now meets besides they would exchange the whaling news\\nand have an agreeable chat for not only would they meet with all the\\nsympathies of sailors but likewise with all the peculiar\\ncongenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared\\nprivations and perils\\n\\nnor would difference of country make any very essential difference\\nthat is so long as both parties speak one language as is the case\\nwith americans and english though to be sure from the small number\\nof english whalers such meetings do not very often occur and when\\nthey do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them\\nfor your englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he does not\\nfancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the english\\nwhalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the\\namerican whalers regarding the long lean nantucketer with his\\nnondescript provincialisms as a sort of seapeasant but where this\\nsuperiority in the english whalemen does really consist it would be\\nhard to say seeing that the yankees in one day collectively kill\\nmore whales than all the english collectively in ten years but this\\nis a harmless little foible in the english whalehunters which the\\nnantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knows\\nthat he has a few foibles himself\\n\\nso then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea the\\nwhalers have most reason to be sociableand they are so whereas some\\nmerchant ships crossing each others wake in the midatlantic will\\noftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition\\nmutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace of dandies\\nin broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism\\nupon each others rig as for menofwar when they chance to meet at\\nsea they first go through such a string of silly bowings and\\nscrapings such a ducking of ensigns that there does not seem to be\\nmuch rightdown hearty goodwill and brotherly love about it at all as\\ntouching slaveships meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurry\\nthey run away from each other as soon as possible and as for pirates\\nwhen they chance to cross each others crossbones the first hail\\nishow many skullsthe same way that whalers hailhow many\\nbarrels and that question once answered pirates straightway steer\\napart for they are infernal villains on both sides and dont like to\\nsee overmuch of each others villanous likenesses\\n\\nbut look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable\\nfreeandeasy whaler what does the whaler do when she meets another\\nwhaler in any sort of decent weather she has a _gam_ a thing so\\nutterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name\\neven and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at it\\nand repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubberboilers and\\nsuch like pretty exclamations why it is that all merchantseamen and\\nalso all pirates and manofwars men and slaveship sailors cherish\\nsuch a scornful feeling towards whaleships this is a question it\\nwould be hard to answer because in the case of pirates say i should\\nlike to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory\\nabout it it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed but only at\\nthe gallows and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion\\nhe has no proper foundation for his superior altitude hence i\\nconclude that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman\\nin that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on\\n\\nbut what is a _gam_ you might wear out your indexfinger running up\\nand down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word dr\\njohnson never attained to that erudition noah websters ark does not\\nhold it nevertheless this same expressive word has now for many years\\nbeen in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees\\ncertainly it needs a definition and should be incorporated into the\\nlexicon with that view let me learnedly define it\\n\\ngam noun_a social meeting of two_ _or more_ _whaleships generally\\non a cruisingground when after exchanging hails they exchange\\nvisits by boats crews the two captains remaining for the time on\\nboard of one ship and the two chief mates on the other_\\n\\nthere is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten\\nhere all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail so\\nhas the whale fishery in a pirate manofwar or slave ship when the\\ncaptain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the stern\\nsheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often\\nsteers himself with a pretty little milliners tiller decorated with\\ngay cords and ribbons but the whaleboat has no seat astern no sofa\\nof that sort whatever and no tiller at all high times indeed if\\nwhaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old\\naldermen in patent chairs and as for a tiller the whaleboat never\\nadmits of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming a complete\\nboats crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or\\nharpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the\\noccasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to\\nhis visit all standing like a pine tree and often you will notice that\\nbeing conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him\\nfrom the sides of the two ships this standing captain is all alive to\\nthe importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs nor\\nis this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense projecting\\nsteering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the\\nafteroar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front he is thus\\ncompletely wedged before and behind and can only expand himself\\nsideways by settling down on his stretched legs but a sudden violent\\npitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length of\\nfoundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make a\\nspread angle of two poles and you cannot stand them up then again\\nit would never do in plain sight of the worlds riveted eyes it would\\nnever do i say for this straddling captain to be seen steadying\\nhimself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his\\nhands indeed as token of his entire buoyant selfcommand he\\ngenerally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets but perhaps being\\ngenerally very large heavy hands he carries them there for ballast\\nnevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones\\ntoo where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment\\nor two in a sudden squall sayto seize hold of the nearest oarsmans\\nhair and hold

she was manned\\nalmost wholly by polynesians in the short gam that ensued she gave us\\nstrong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white\\nwhale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the townhos\\nstory which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain\\nwondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of\\ngod which at times are said to overtake some men this latter\\ncircumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may\\nbe called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never\\nreached the ears of captain ahab or his mates for that secret part of\\nthe story was unknown to the captain of the townho himself it was the\\nprivate property of three confederate white seamen of that ship one of\\nwhom it seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of\\nsecrecy but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and\\nrevealed so much of it in that way that when he was wakened he could\\nnot well withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an influence did\\nthis thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the full\\nknowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were\\nthey governed in this matter that they kept the secret among\\nthemselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequods mainmast\\ninterweaving in its proper place this darker thread with

one\\nsaints eve smoking upon the thickgilt tiled piazza of the golden\\ninn of those fine cavaliers the young dons pedro and sebastian were\\non the closer terms with me and hence the interluding questions they\\noccasionally put and which are duly answered at the time\\n\\nsome two years prior to my first learning the events which i am about\\nrehearsing to you gentlemen the townho sperm whaler of nantucket\\nwas cruising in your pacific here not very many days sail eastward\\nfrom the eaves of this good golden inn she was somewhere to the\\nnorthward of the line one morning upon handling the pumps according\\nto daily usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold\\nthan common they supposed a swordfish had stabbed her gentlemen but\\nthe captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good\\nluck awaited him in those latitudes and therefore being very averse to\\nquit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous\\nthough indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low\\ndown as was possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued\\nher cruisings the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy\\nintervals but no good luck came more days went by and not only was\\nthe leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much so that\\nnow taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the\\nnearest harbor among the islands there to have his hull hove out and\\nrepaired\\n\\nthough no small passage was before her yet if the commonest chance\\nfavoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the\\nway because his pumps were of the best and being periodically\\nrelieved at them those sixandthirty men of his could easily keep the\\nship free never mind if the leak should double on her in truth well\\nnigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous\\nbreezes the townho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at\\nher port without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been\\nfor the brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the\\nbitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and

of its rimmed varieties of\\nraces and of climes they contain round archipelagoes of romantic\\nisles even as the polynesian waters do in large part are shored by\\ntwo great contrasting nations as

their peltry wigwams for leagues and leagues are flanked by\\nancient and unentered forests where the gaunt pines stand like serried\\nlines of kings in gothic genealogies those same woods harboring

know what shipwrecks\\nare for out of sight of land however inland they have drowned full\\nmany a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew thus gentlemen\\nthough an inlander steelkilt was wildocean born and wildocean\\nnurtured as much of an audacious mariner as any and for radney\\nthough in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket\\nbeach to nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long\\nfollowed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific yet was\\nhe quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods\\nseaman fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn handled bowieknives yet\\nwas this nantucketer a man with some goodhearted traits and this\\nlakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by\\ninflexible firmness only tempered by that common decency of human\\nrecognition which is the meanest slaves right thus treated this\\nsteelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile at all events he\\nhad proved so thus far but radney was doomed and made mad and\\nsteelkiltbut gentlemen you shall hear\\n\\nit was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her\\nprow for her island haven that the townhos leak seemed again\\nincreasing but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps\\nevery day you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our\\natlantic for example some skippers think little of pumping their\\nwhole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the\\nofficer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect the\\nprobability would be that he and his shipmates would never again\\nremember it on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom\\nnor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward\\ngentlemen is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their\\npumphandles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length\\nthat is if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other\\nreasonable retreat is afforded them it is only when a leaky vessel is\\nin some very out of the way part of those waters some really landless\\nlatitude that her captain begins to feel a little anxious\\n\\nmuch this way had it been with the townho so when her leak was found\\ngaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested by\\nseveral of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded the\\nupper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way\\nexpanded to the breeze now this radney i suppose was as little of a\\ncoward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness\\ntouching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land or\\non sea that you can conveniently imagine gentlemen therefore when he\\nbetrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the\\nseamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner\\nin her so when they were working that evening at the pumps there was\\non this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as they\\nstood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear\\nwater clear as any mountain spring gentlementhat bubbling from the\\npumps ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at\\nthe lee scupperholes\\n\\nnow as you well know it is not seldom the case in this conventional\\nworld of ourswatery or otherwise that when a person placed in command\\nover his fellowmen finds one of them to be very significantly his\\nsuperior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he\\nconceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a\\nchance he will pull down and pulverize that subalterns tower and make\\na little heap of dust of it be this conceit of mine as it may\\ngentlemen at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a\\nhead like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled\\nhousings of your last viceroys snorting charger and a brain and a\\nheart and a soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkilt\\ncharlemagne had he been born son to charlemagnes father but radney\\nthe mate was ugly as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicious\\nhe did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew it\\n\\nespying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the\\nrest the lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went on with\\nhis gay banterings\\n\\naye aye my merry lads its a lively leak this hold a cannikin\\none of ye and lets have a taste by the lord its worth bottling i\\ntell ye what men old rads investment must go for it he had best cut\\naway his part of the hull and tow it home the fact is boys that\\nswordfish only began the job hes come back again with a gang of\\nshipcarpenters sawfish and filefish and what not and the whole\\nposse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom\\nmaking improvements i suppose if old rad were here now id tell him\\nto jump overboard and scatter em theyre playing the devil with his\\nestate i can tell him but hes a simple old soulrad and a beauty\\ntoo boys they say the rest of his property is invested in\\nlookingglasses i wonder if hed give a poor devil like me the model\\nof his nose\\n\\ndamn your eyes whats that pump stopping for roared radney\\npretending not to have heard the sailors talk thunder away at it\\n\\naye aye sir said steelkilt merry as a cricket lively boys\\nlively now and with that the pump clanged like fifty fireengines\\nthe men tossed their hats off to it and ere long that peculiar gasping\\nof the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of lifes\\nutmost energies\\n\\nquitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the lakeman went\\nforward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face\\nfiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his\\nbrow now what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessed radney\\nto meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state i know\\nnot but so it happened intolerably striding along the deck the mate\\ncommanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also a\\nshovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a\\npig to run at large\\n\\nnow gentlemen sweeping a ships deck at sea is a piece of household\\nwork which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\\nevening it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\\nfoundering at the time such gentlemen is the inflexibility of\\nseausages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen some of whom\\nwould not willingly drown without first washing their faces but in all\\nvessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys\\nif boys there be aboard besides it was the stronger men in the\\ntownho that had been divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps\\nand being the most athletic seaman of them all steelkilt had been\\nregularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he should\\nhave been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly\\nnautical duties such being the case with his comrades i mention all\\nthese particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair\\nstood between the two men\\n\\nbut there was more than this the order about the shovel was almost as\\nplainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt as though radney had spat\\nin his face any man who has gone sailor in a whaleship will\\nunderstand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman\\nfully comprehended when the mate uttered his command but as he sat\\nstill for a moment and as he steadfastly looked into the mates\\nmalignant eye and perceived the stacks of powdercasks heaped up in him\\nand the slowmatch silently burning along towards them as he\\ninstinctively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness\\nto stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful beinga\\nrepugnance most felt when felt at all by really valiant men even when\\naggrievedthis nameless phantom feeling gentlemen stole over\\nsteelkilt\\n\\ntherefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodily\\nexhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him saying that sweeping\\nthe deck was not his business and he would not do it and then\\nwithout at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as the\\ncustomary sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done\\nlittle or nothing all day to this radney replied with an oath in a\\nmost domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his\\ncommand meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an\\nuplifted coopers club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near\\nby\\n\\nheated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps for\\nall his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt\\ncould but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still\\nsmothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained\\ndoggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed radney shook the\\nhammer within a few inches of his face furiously commanding him to do\\nhis bidding\\n\\nsteelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadily\\nfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated\\nhis intention not to obey seeing however that his forbearance had\\nnot the slightest effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\\nhis twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but it\\nwas to no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round the\\nwindlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him\\nthat he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor the\\nlakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer\\n\\nmr radney i will not obey you take that hammer away or look to\\nyourself but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where\\nthe lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of\\nhis teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions\\nretreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye\\nwith the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching his\\nright hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his\\npersecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would\\nmurder him but gentlemen the fool had been branded for the slaughter\\nby the gods immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant\\nthe lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch\\nspouting blood like a whale\\n\\nere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\\nleading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their\\nmastheads they were both canallers\\n\\ncanallers cried don pedro we have seen many whaleships in our\\nharbours but never heard of your canallers pardon who and what are\\nthey\\n\\ncanallers don are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal\\nyou must have heard of it\\n\\nnay senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary\\nland we know but little of your vigorous north\\n\\naye well then don refill my cup your chichas very fine and ere\\nproceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are for such\\ninformation may throw sidelight upon my story\\n\\nfor three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through the entire\\nbreadth of the state of new york through numerous populous cities and\\nmost thriving villages through long dismal uninhabited swamps and\\naffluent cultivated fields unrivalled for fertility by billiardroom\\nand barroom through the holyofholies of great forests on roman\\narches over indian rivers through sun and shade by happy hearts or\\nbroken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk\\ncounties and especially by rows of snowwhite chapels whose spires\\nstand almost like milestones flows one continual stream of venetianly\\ncorrupt and often lawless life theres your true ashantee gentlemen\\nthere howl your pagans where you ever find them next door to you\\nunder the longflung shadow and the snug patronising lee of churches\\nfor by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your metropolitan\\nfreebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice so\\nsinners gentlemen most abound in holiest vicinities\\n\\nis that a friar passing said don pedro looking downwards into the\\ncrowded plazza with humorous concern\\n\\nwell for our northern friend dame isabellas inquisition wanes in\\nlima laughed don sebastian proceed senor\\n\\na moment pardon cried another of the company in the name of all\\nus limeese i but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by\\nno means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima for\\ndistant venice in your corrupt comparison oh do not bow and look\\nsurprised you know the proverb all along this coastcorrupt as lima\\nit but bears out your saying too churches more plentiful than\\nbilliardtables and for ever openand corrupt as lima so too\\nvenice i have been there the holy city of the blessed evangelist st\\nmarkst dominic purge it your cup thanks here i refill now you\\npour out again\\n\\nfreely depicted in his own vocation gentlemen the canaller would\\nmake a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is\\nhe like mark antony for days and days along his greenturfed flowery\\nnile he indolently floats openly toying with his redcheeked\\ncleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore\\nall this effeminacy is dashed the brigandish guise which the canaller\\nso proudly sports his slouched and gailyribboned hat betoken his\\ngrand features a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages\\nthrough which he floats his swart visage and bold swagger are not\\nunshunned in cities once a vagabond on his own canal i have received\\ngood turns from one of these canallers i thank him heartily would\\nfain be not ungrateful but it is often one of the prime redeeming\\nqualities of your man of violence that at times he has as stiff an arm\\nto back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one in\\nsum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is is\\nemphatically evinced by this that our wild whalefishery contains so\\nmany of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race of\\nmankind except sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling\\ncaptains nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter\\nthat to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its\\nline the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole\\ntransition between quietly reaping in a christian cornfield and\\nrecklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas\\n\\ni see i see impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chicha\\nupon his silvery ruffles no need to travel the worlds one lima i\\nhad thought now that at your temperate north the generations were\\ncold and holy as the hillsbut the story\\n\\ni left off gentlemen where the lakeman shook the backstay hardly\\nhad he done so when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and\\nthe four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck but sliding down\\nthe ropes like baleful comets the two canallers rushed into the\\nuproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle\\nothers of the sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted\\nturmoil ensued while standing out of harms way the valiant captain\\ndanced up and down with a whalepike calling upon his officers to\\nmanhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the\\nquarterdeck at intervals he ran close up to the revolving border of\\nthe confusion and prying into the heart of it with his pike sought to\\nprick out the object of his resentment but steelkilt and his\\ndesperadoes were too much for them all they succeeded in gaining the\\nforecastle deck where hastily slewing about three or four large casks\\nin a line with the windlass these seaparisians entrenched themselves\\nbehind the barricade\\n\\ncome out of that ye pirates roared the captain now menacing them\\nwith a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward come\\nout of that ye cutthroats\\n\\nsteelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there\\ndefied the worst the pistols could do but gave the captain to\\nunderstand distinctly that his steelkilts death would be the signal\\nfor a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands fearing in his heart\\nlest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but\\nstill commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty\\n\\nwill you promise not to touch us if we do demanded their\\nringleader\\n\\nturn to turn toi make no promiseto your duty do you want to\\nsink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to and he\\nonce more raised a pistol\\n\\nsink the ship cried steelkilt aye let her sink not a man of us\\nturns to unless you swear not to raise a ropeyarn against us what\\nsay ye men turning to his comrades a fierce cheer was their\\nresponse\\n\\nthe lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye\\non the captain and jerking out such sentences as theseits not our\\nfault we didnt want it i told him to take his hammer away it was\\nboys business he might have known me before this i told him not to\\nprick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here against his\\ncursed jaw aint those mincing knives down in the forecastle there\\nmen look to those handspikes my hearties captain by god look to\\nyourself say the word dont be a fool forget it all we are ready to\\nturn to treat us decently and were your men but we wont be\\nflogged\\n\\nturn to i make no promises turn to i say\\n\\nlook ye now cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards him\\nthere are a few of us here and i am one of them who have shipped for\\nthe cruise dye see now as you well know sir we can claim our\\ndischarge as soon as the anchor is down so we dont want a row its\\nnot our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but we\\nwont be flogged\\n\\nturn to roared the captain\\n\\nsteelkilt glanced round him a moment and then saidi tell you what\\nit is now captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabby\\nrascal we wont lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us but till\\nyou say the word about not flogging us we dont do a hands turn\\n\\ndown into the forecastle then down with ye ill keep ye there till\\nyere sick of it down ye go\\n\\nshall we cried the ringleader to his men most of them were against\\nit but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him down\\ninto their dark den growlingly disappearing like bears into a cave\\n\\nas the lakemans bare head was just level with the planks the captain\\nand his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slide\\nof the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and loudly called\\nfor the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the\\ncompanionway then opening the slide a little the captain whispered\\nsomething down the crack closed it and turned the key upon themten\\nin numberleaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had\\nremained neutral\\n\\nall night a wideawake watch was kept by all the officers forward and\\naft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at\\nwhich last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge after\\nbreaking through the bulkhead below but the hours of darkness passed\\nin peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the\\npumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary\\nnight dismally resounded through the ship\\n\\nat sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck\\nsummoned the prisoners to work but with a yell they refused water was\\nthen lowered down to them and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were\\ntossed after it when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it\\nthe captain returned to the quarterdeck twice every day for three\\ndays this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling\\nand then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered\\nand suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were\\nready to turn to the fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet\\nunited perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution had constrained\\nthem to surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain\\nreiterated his demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a\\nterrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he\\nbelonged on the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up\\ninto the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain\\nthem only three were left\\n\\nbetter turn to now said the captain with a heartless jeer\\n\\nshut us up again will ye cried steelkilt\\n\\noh certainly said the captain and the key clicked\\n\\nit was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defection of\\nseven of his former associates and stung by the mocking voice that had\\nlast hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a place as\\nblack as the bowels of despair it was then that steelkilt proposed to\\nthe two canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burst\\nout of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armed with\\ntheir keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implements with a\\nhandle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if\\nby any devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for\\nhimself he would do this he said whether they joined him or not\\nthat was the last night he should spend in that den but the scheme met\\nwith no opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were\\nready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a\\nsurrender and what was more they each insisted upon being the first\\nman on deck when the time to make the rush should come but to this\\ntheir leader as fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself\\nparticularly as his two comrades would not yield the one to the other\\nin the matter and both of them could not be first for the ladder\\nwould but admit one man at a time and here gentlemen the foul play\\nof these miscreants must come out\\n\\nupon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his own\\nseparate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece\\nof treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be\\nthe first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and\\nthereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might\\nmerit but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead\\nthem to the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry of\\nvillany mixed their before secret treacheries together and when their\\nleader fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other in\\nthree sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him with\\ncords and shrieked out for the captain at midnight\\n\\nthinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he\\nand all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle in a\\nfew minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still\\nstruggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious\\nallies who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been\\nfully ripe for murder but all these were collared and dragged along\\nthe deck like dead cattle and side by side were seized up into the\\nmizzen rigging like three quarters of meat and there they hung till\\nmorning damn ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before them\\nthe vultures would not touch ye ye villains\\n\\nat sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who had\\nrebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the\\nformer that he had a good mind to flog them all roundthought upon the\\nwhole he would do sohe ought tojustice demanded it but for the\\npresent considering their timely surrender he would let them go with\\na reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular\\n\\nbut as for you ye carrion rogues turning to the three men in the\\nriggingfor you i mean to mince ye up for the trypots and seizing\\na rope he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two\\ntraitors till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung their heads\\nsideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn\\n\\nmy wrist is sprained with ye he cried at last but there is still\\nrope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldnt give up take\\nthat gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for himself\\n\\nfor a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his\\ncramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in a\\nsort of hiss what i say is thisand mind it wellif you flog me i\\nmurder you\\n\\nsay ye so then see how ye frighten meand the captain drew off with\\nthe rope to strike\\n\\nbest not hissed the lakeman\\n\\nbut i mustand the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke\\n\\nsteelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain\\nwho to the amazement of all hands started back paced the deck\\nrapidly two or three times and then suddenly throwing down his rope\\nsaid i wont do itlet him gocut him down dye hear\\n\\nbut as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a pale\\nman with a bandaged head arrested themradney the chief mate ever\\nsince the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the\\ntumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the\\nwhole scene such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly\\nspeak but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do\\nwhat the captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced\\nto his pinioned foe\\n\\nyou are a coward hissed the lakeman\\n\\nso i am but take that the mate was in the very act of striking\\nwhen another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing\\nno more made good his word spite of steelkilts threat whatever that\\nmight have been the three men were then cut down all hands were\\nturned to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumps\\nclanged as before\\n\\njust after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamor\\nwas heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors running up\\nbesieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew\\nentreaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own\\ninstance they were put down in the ships run for salvation still no\\nsign of mutiny reappeared among the rest on the contrary it seemed\\nthat mainly at steelkilts instigation they had resolved to maintain\\nthe strictest peacefulness obey all orders to the last and when the\\nship reached port desert her in a body but in order to insure the\\nspeediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thingnamely\\nnot to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered for\\nspite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the townho still\\nmaintained her mastheads and her captain was just as willing to lower\\nfor a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck the\\ncruising ground and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his\\nberth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the\\nvital jaw of the whale\\n\\nbut though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\\npassiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till\\nall was over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the\\nman who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart he was in radney\\nthe chief mates watch and as if the infatuated man sought to run more\\nthan half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging he\\ninsisted against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming the\\nhead of his watch at night upon this and one or two other\\ncircumstances steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge\\n\\nduring the night radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\\nbulwarks of the quarterdeck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of\\nthe boat which was hoisted up there a little above the ships side in\\nthis attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed there was a\\nconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between\\nthis was the sea steelkilt calculated his time and found that his\\nnext trick at the helm would come round at two oclock in the morning\\nof the third day from that in which he had been betrayed at his\\nleisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully\\nin his watches below\\n\\nwhat are you making there said a shipmate\\n\\nwhat do you think what does it look like\\n\\nlike a lanyard for your bag but its an odd one seems to me\\n\\nyes rather oddish said the lakeman holding it at arms length\\nbefore him but i think it will answer shipmate i havent enough\\ntwinehave you any\\n\\nbut there was none in the forecastle\\n\\nthen i must get some from old rad and he rose to go aft\\n\\nyou dont mean to go a begging to _him_ said a sailor\\n\\nwhy not do you think he wont do me a turn when its to help\\nhimself in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked at him\\nquietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it was given\\nhimneither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an\\niron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the\\nlakemans monkey jacket as he was tucking the coat into his hammock\\nfor a pillow twentyfour hours after his trick at the silent\\nhelmnigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready\\ndug to the seamans handthat fatal hour was then to come and in the\\nforeordaining soul of steelkilt the mate was already stark and\\nstretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed in\\n\\nbut gentlemen a fool saved the wouldbe murderer from the bloody\\ndeed he had planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the\\navenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven itself seemed to step in\\nto take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have\\ndone\\n\\nit was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second\\nday when they were washing down the decks that a stupid teneriffe\\nman drawing water in the mainchains all at once shouted out there\\nshe rolls there she rolls jesu what a whale it was moby dick\\n\\nmoby dick cried don sebastian st dominic sir sailor but do\\nwhales have christenings whom call you moby dick\\n\\na very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster donbut\\nthat would be too long a story\\n\\nhow how cried all the young spaniards crowding\\n\\nnay dons donsnay nay i cannot rehearse that now let me get more\\ninto the air sirs\\n\\nthe chicha the chicha cried don pedro our vigorous friend looks\\nfaintfill up his empty glass\\n\\nno need gentlemen one moment and i proceednow gentlemen so\\nsuddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the\\nshipforgetful of the compact among the crewin the excitement of the\\nmoment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted\\nhis voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been\\nplainly beheld from the three sullen mastheads all was now a phrensy\\nthe white whalethe white whale was the cry from captain mates and\\nharpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumours were all anxious to\\ncapture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed\\naskance and with curses the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass\\nthat lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like a\\nliving opal in the blue morning sea gentlemen a strange fatality\\npervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped out\\nbefore the world itself was charted the mutineer was the bowsman of\\nthe mate and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next him\\nwhile radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or\\nslacken the line at the word of command moreover when the four boats\\nwere lowered the mates got the start and none howled more fiercely\\nwith delight than did steelkilt as he strained at his oar after a\\nstiff pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand radney\\nsprang to the bow he was always a furious man it seems in a boat\\nand now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the whales topmost back\\nnothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding\\nfoam that blent two whitenesses together till of a sudden the boat\\nstruck as against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the\\nstanding mate that instant as he fell on the whales slippery back\\nthe boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while radney was\\ntossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale he struck\\nout through the spray and for an instant was dimly seen through that\\nveil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick but\\nthe whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer\\nbetween his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again\\nand went down\\n\\nmeantime at the first tap of the boats bottom the lakeman had\\nslackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly\\nlooking on he thought his own thoughts but a sudden terrific\\ndownward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line he\\ncut it and the whale was free but at some distance moby dick rose\\nagain with some tatters of radneys red woollen shirt caught in the\\nteeth that had destroyed him all four boats gave chase again but the\\nwhale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared\\n\\nin good time the townho reached her porta savage solitary\\nplacewhere no civilized creature resided there headed by the\\nlakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted\\namong the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large double\\nwarcanoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor\\n\\nthe ships company being reduced to but a handful the captain called\\nupon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving\\ndown the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance over\\ntheir dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both\\nby night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent\\nthat upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a\\nweakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so\\nheavy a vessel after taking counsel with his officers he anchored the\\nship as far off shore as possible loaded and ran out his two cannon\\nfrom the bows stacked his muskets on the poop and warning the\\nislanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man with\\nhim and setting the sail of his best whaleboat steered straight\\nbefore the wind for tahiti five hundred miles distant to procure a\\nreinforcement to his crew\\n\\non the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which\\nseemed to have touched at a low isle of corals he steered away from\\nit but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of\\nsteelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water the\\ncaptain presented a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yoked\\nwarcanoes the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if the\\npistol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubbles and\\nfoam\\n\\nwhat do you want of me cried the captain\\n\\nwhere are you bound and for what are you bound demanded steelkilt\\nno lies\\n\\ni am bound to tahiti for more men\\n\\nvery good let me board you a momenti come in peace with that he\\nleaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale\\nstood face to face with the captain\\n\\ncross your arms sir throw back your head now repeat after me as\\nsoon as steelkilt leaves me i swear to beach this boat on yonder\\nisland and remain there six days if i do not may lightnings strike\\nme\\n\\na pretty scholar laughed the lakeman adios senor and leaping\\ninto the sea he swam back to his comrades\\n\\nwatching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the\\nroots of the cocoanut trees steelkilt made sail again and in due\\ntime arrived at tahiti his own place of destination there luck\\nbefriended him two ships were about to sail for france and were\\nprovidentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor\\nheaded they embarked and so for ever got the start of their former\\ncaptain had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution\\n\\nsome ten days after the french ships sailed the whaleboat arrived\\nand the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized\\ntahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small\\nnative schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all\\nright there again resumed his cruisings\\n\\nwhere steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island of\\nnantucket the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses to\\ngive up its dead still in dreams sees the awful white whale that\\ndestroyed him     \\n\\nare you through said don sebastian quietly\\n\\ni am don\\n\\nthen i entreat you tell me if to the best of your own convictions\\nthis your story is in substance really true it is so passing\\nwonderful did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me\\nif i seem to press\\n\\nalso bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in don\\nsebastians suit cried the company with exceeding interest\\n\\nis there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn\\ngentlemen\\n\\nnay said don sebastian but i know a worthy priest near by who\\nwill quickly procure one for me i go for it but are you well advised\\nthis may grow too serious\\n\\nwill you be so good as to bring the priest also don\\n\\nthough there are no autodafés in

after you don sebastian but may i also beg\\nthat you will be particular in procuring the largest sized evangelists\\nyou can\\n\\n     \\n\\nthis is the priest he brings you the evangelists said don\\nsebastian gravely returning with a tall and solemn figure\\n\\nlet me remove my hat now venerable priest further into the light\\nand hold the holy book before me that i may touch it\\n\\nso help me heaven and on my honor the story i have told ye\\ngentlemen is in substance and its great items true i know it to be\\ntrue it happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew the crew i\\nhave seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney\\n\\n\\nchapter 55 of the monstrous pictures of whales\\n\\ni shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas\\nsomething like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the\\neye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored\\nalongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there\\nit may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious\\nimaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day\\nconfidently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time to set the\\nworld right in this matter by proving such pictures of the whale all\\nwrong\\n\\nit may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will\\nbe found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptures for\\never since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble\\npanellings of temples the pedestals of statues and on shields\\nmedallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn in scales of\\nchainarmor like saladins and a helmeted head like st georges ever\\nsince then has something of the same sort of license prevailed not\\nonly in most popular pictures of the whale but in many scientific\\npresentations of him\\n\\nnow by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\\nto be the whales is to be found in the famous cavernpagoda of\\nelephanta in india the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless\\nsculptures of that immemorial pagoda all the trades and pursuits\\nevery conceivable avocation of man were prefigured ages before any of\\nthem actually came into being no wonder then that in some sort our\\nnoble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth the\\nhindoo whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall\\ndepicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly\\nknown as the matse avatar but though this sculpture is half man and\\nhalf whale so as only to give the tail of the latter yet that small\\nsection of him is all wrong it looks more like the tapering tail of an\\nanaconda than the broad palms of the true whales majestic flukes\\n\\nbut go to the old galleries and look now at a great christian\\npainters portrait of this fish for he succeeds no better than the\\nantediluvian hindoo it is guidos picture of perseus rescuing\\nandromeda from the seamonster or whale where did guido get the model\\nof such a strange creature as that nor does hogarth in painting the\\nsame scene in his own perseus descending make out one whit better\\nthe huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the\\nsurface scarcely drawing one inch of water it has a sort of howdah on\\nits back and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are\\nrolling might be taken for the traitors gate leading from the thames\\nby water into the tower then there are the prodromus whales of old\\nscotch sibbald and jonahs whale as depicted in the prints of old\\nbibles and the cuts of old primers what shall be said of these as for\\nthe bookbinders whale winding like a vinestalk round the stock of a\\ndescending anchoras stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages of\\nmany books both old and newthat is a very picturesque but purely\\nfabulous creature imitated i take it from the like figures on\\nantique vases though universally denominated a dolphin i nevertheless\\ncall this bookbinders fish an attempt at a whale because it was so\\nintended when the device was first introduced it was introduced by an\\nold italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century during the\\nrevival of learning and in those days and even down to a\\ncomparatively late period dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\\nspecies of the leviathan\\n\\nin the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\\nwill at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where all\\nmanner of spouts jets deau hot springs and cold saratoga and\\nbadenbaden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain in the\\ntitlepage of the original edition of the advancement of learning you\\nwill find some curious whales\\n\\nbut quitting all these unprofessional attempts let us glance at those\\npictures of leviathan purporting to be sober scientific delineations\\nby those who know in old harriss collection of voyages there are some\\nplates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages ad 1671\\nentitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the\\nwhale peter peterson of friesland master in one of those plates the\\nwhales like great rafts of logs are represented lying among\\niceisles with white bears running over their living backs in another\\nplate the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with\\nperpendicular flukes\\n\\nthen again there is an imposing quarto written by one captain\\ncolnett a post captain in the english navy entitled a voyage round\\ncape horn into the south seas for the purpose of extending the\\nspermaceti whale fisheries in this book is an outline purporting to\\nbe a picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from\\none killed on the coast of mexico august 1793 and hoisted on deck\\ni doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the\\nbenefit of his marines to mention but one thing about it let me say\\nthat it has an eye which applied according to the accompanying scale\\nto a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a\\nbowwindow some five feet long ah my gallant captain why did ye not\\ngive us jonah looking out of that eye\\n\\nnor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the\\nbenefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of\\nmistake look at that popular work goldsmiths animated nature in\\nthe abridged london edition of 1807 there are plates of an alleged\\nwhale and a narwhale i do not wish to seem inelegant but this\\nunsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow and as for the\\nnarwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this\\nnineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon\\nany intelligent public of schoolboys\\n\\nthen again in 1825 bernard germain count de lacépède a great\\nnaturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are\\nseveral pictures of the different species of the leviathan all these\\nare not only incorrect but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland\\nwhale that is to say the right whale even scoresby a long\\nexperienced man as touching that species declares not to have its\\ncounterpart in nature\\n\\nbut the placing of the capsheaf to all this blundering business was\\nreserved for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to the famous\\nbaron in 1836 he published a natural history of whales in which he\\ngives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale before showing that\\npicture to any nantucketer you had best provide for your summary\\nretreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuviers sperm whale is\\nnot a sperm whale but a squash of course he never had the benefit of\\na whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived that\\npicture who can tell perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor\\nin the same field desmarest got one of his authentic abortions that\\nis from a chinese drawing and what sort of lively lads with the\\npencil those chinese are many queer cups and saucers inform us\\n\\nas for the signpainters whales seen in the streets hanging over the\\nshops of oildealers what shall be said of them they are generally\\nrichard iii whales with dromedary humps and very savage\\nbreakfasting on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full of\\nmariners their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\\npaint\\n\\nbut these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\\nsurprising after all consider most of the scientific drawings have\\nbeen taken from the stranded fish and these are about as correct as a\\ndrawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly represent\\nthe noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars\\nthough elephants have stood for their fulllengths the living\\nleviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait the\\nliving whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen\\nat sea in unfathomable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out\\nof sight like a launched lineofbattle ship and out of that element\\nit is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily\\ninto the air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations\\nand not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour\\nbetween a young sucking whale and a fullgrown platonian leviathan\\nyet even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a\\nships deck such is then the outlandish eellike limbered varying\\nshape of him that his precise expression the devil himself could not\\ncatch\\n\\nbut it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\\nwhale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form not at\\nall for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan\\nthat his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape though\\njeremy benthams skeleton which hangs for candelabra in the library of\\none of his executors correctly conveys the idea of a burlybrowed\\nutilitarian old gentleman with all jeremys other leading personal\\ncharacteristics yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any\\nleviathans articulated bones in fact as the great hunter says the\\nmere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully\\ninvested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so\\nroundingly envelopes it this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the\\nhead as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown it is\\nalso very curiously displayed in the side fin the bones of which\\nalmost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand minus only the\\nthumb this fin has four regular bonefingers the index middle ring\\nand little finger but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy\\ncovering as the human fingers in an artificial covering however\\nrecklessly the whale may sometimes serve us said humorous stubb one\\nday he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens\\n\\nfor all these reasons then any way you may look at it you must needs\\nconclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world\\nwhich must remain unpainted to the last true one portrait may hit the\\nmark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any very\\nconsiderable degree of exactness so there is no earthly way of finding\\nout precisely what the whale really looks like and the only mode in\\nwhich you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is by\\ngoing a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of\\nbeing eternally stove and sunk by him wherefore it seems to me you\\nhad best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this\\nleviathan\\n\\n\\nchapter 56 of the less erroneous pictures of whales and the true\\npictures of whaling scenes\\n\\nin connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales i am strongly\\ntempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them\\nwhich are to be found in certain books both ancient and modern\\nespecially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier etc but i pass\\nthat matter by\\n\\ni know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale\\ncolnetts hugginss frederick cuviers and beales in the previous\\nchapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to hugginss is far\\nbetter than theirs but by great odds beales is the best all\\nbeales drawings of this whale are good excepting the middle figure in\\nthe picture of three whales in various attitudes capping his second\\nchapter his frontispiece boats attacking sperm whales though no\\ndoubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is\\nadmirably correct and lifelike in its general effect some of the\\nsperm whale drawings in j ross browne are pretty correct in contour\\nbut they are wretchedly engraved that is not his fault though\\n\\nof the right whale the best outline pictures are in scoresby but they\\nare drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression he has\\nbut one picture of whaling scenes and this is a sad deficiency\\nbecause it is by such pictures only when at all well done that you\\ncan derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by\\nhis living hunters\\n\\nbut taken for all in all by far the finest though in some details\\nnot the most correct presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be\\nanywhere found are two large french engravings well executed and\\ntaken from paintings by one garnery respectively they represent\\nattacks on the sperm and right whale in the first engraving a noble\\nsperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneath\\nthe boat from the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in the\\nair upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks the prow of\\nthe boat is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon the\\nmonsters spine and standing in that prow for that one single\\nincomputable flash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded by the\\nincensed boiling spout of the whale and in the act of leaping as if\\nfrom a precipice the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and\\ntrue the halfemptied linetub floats on the whitened sea the wooden\\npoles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the\\nswimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions\\nof affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing\\ndown upon the scene serious fault might be found with the anatomical\\ndetails of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me i\\ncould not draw so good a one\\n\\nin the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\\nthe barnacled flank of a large running right whale that rolls his\\nblack weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rockslide from the\\npatagonian cliffs his jets are erect full and black like soot so\\nthat from so abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think there\\nmust be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below sea fowls are\\npecking at the small crabs shellfish and other sea candies and\\nmaccaroni which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\\nback and all the while the thicklipped leviathan is rushing through\\nthe deep leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake and\\ncausing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh\\nthe paddlewheels of an ocean steamer thus the foreground is all\\nraging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is the\\nglassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sails of the\\npowerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conquered\\nfortress with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whalepole\\ninserted into his spouthole\\n\\nwho garnery the painter is or was i know not but my life for it he\\nwas either practically conversant with his subject or else\\nmarvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman the french are the\\nlads for painting action go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe\\nand where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing\\ncommotion on canvas as in that triumphal hall at versailles where the\\nbeholder fights his way pellmell through the consecutive great\\nbattles of france where every sword seems a flash of the northern\\nlights and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by like a\\ncharge of crowned centaurs not wholly unworthy of a place in that\\ngallery are these sea battlepieces of garnery\\n\\nthe natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of\\nthings seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings\\nthey have of their whaling scenes with not one tenth of englands\\nexperience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the\\namericans they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only\\nfinished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the\\nwhale hunt for the most part the english and american whale\\ndraughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical\\noutline of things such as the vacant profile of the whale which so\\nfar as picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to\\nsketching the profile of a pyramid even scoresby the justly renowned\\nright whaleman after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland\\nwhale and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and\\nporpoises treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks\\nchopping knives and grapnels and with the microscopic diligence of a\\nleuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninetysix\\nfacsimiles of magnified arctic snow crystals i mean no disparagement\\nto the excellent voyager i honor him for a veteran but in so\\nimportant a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured\\nfor every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of\\nthe peace\\n\\nin addition to those fine engravings from garnery there are two other\\nfrench engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself\\nh durand one of them though not precisely adapted to our present\\npurpose nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts it is a quiet\\nnoonscene among the isles of the pacific a french whaler anchored\\ninshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened\\nsails of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background\\nboth drooping together in the breezeless air the effect is very fine\\nwhen considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen\\nunder one of their few aspects of oriental repose the other engraving\\nis quite a different affair the ship hoveto upon the open sea and in\\nthe very heart of the leviathanic life with a right whale alongside\\nthe vessel in the act of cuttingin hove over to the monster as if to\\na quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity\\nis about giving chase to whales in the distance the harpoons and\\nlances lie levelled for use three oarsmen are just setting the mast in\\nits hole

far to invest it with\\nportentousness so rarely is it beheld that though one and all of them\\ndeclare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few\\nof them have any but the most

presented\\ni have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whaleline\\n\\nthe line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp slightly\\nvapored with tar not impregnated with it as in the case of ordinary\\nropes for while tar as ordinarily used makes the hemp more pliable\\nto the ropemaker and also renders the rope itself more convenient to\\nthe sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary\\nquantity too much stiffen the whaleline for the close coiling to which\\nit must be subjected but as most seamen are beginning to learn tar in\\ngeneral by no means adds to the ropes durability or strength however\\nmuch it may give it compactness and gloss\\n\\nof late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almost\\nentirely superseded hemp as a material for whalelines for though not\\nso durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic and\\ni will add since there is an æsthetics in all things is much more\\nhandsome and becoming to the boat than hemp hemp is a dusky dark\\nfellow a sort of indian but manilla is as a goldenhaired circassian\\nto behold\\n\\nthe whaleline is only twothirds of an inch in thickness at first\\nsight you would not think it so strong as it really is by experiment\\nits one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and\\ntwenty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal\\nto three tons in length the common sperm whaleline measures\\nsomething over two hundred fathoms towards the stern of the boat it is\\nspirally coiled away in the tub not like the wormpipe of a still\\nthough but so as to form one round cheeseshaped mass of densely\\nbedded sheaves or layers of concentric spiralizations without any\\nhollow but the heart or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of\\nthe cheese as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would in\\nrunning out infallibly take somebodys arm leg or entire body off\\nthe utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub some\\nharpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business\\ncarrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a\\nblock towards the tub so as in the act of coiling to free it from all\\npossible wrinkles and twists\\n\\nin the english boats two tubs are used instead of one the same line\\nbeing continuously coiled in both tubs there is some advantage in\\nthis because these twintubs being so small they fit more readily into\\nthe boat and do not strain it so much whereas the american tub\\nnearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth makes a\\nrather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one halfinch in\\nthickness for the bottom of the whaleboat is like critical ice which\\nwill bear up a considerable distributed weight but not very much of a\\nconcentrated one when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the\\namerican linetub the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a\\nprodigious great weddingcake to present to the whales\\n\\nboth ends of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an\\neyesplice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the\\ntub and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything\\nthis arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts first\\nin order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a\\nneighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to\\nthreaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the\\nharpoon in these instances the whale of course is shifted like a mug\\nof ale as it were from the one boat to the other though the first\\nboat always hovers at hand to assist its consort second this\\narrangement is indispensable for common safetys sake for were the\\nlower end of the line in any way attached to the boat and were the\\nwhale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking\\nminute as he sometimes does he would not stop there for the doomed\\nboat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of\\nthe sea and in that case no towncrier would ever find her again\\n\\nbefore lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line is\\ntaken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there is\\nagain carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise\\nupon the loom or handle of every mans oar so that it jogs against his\\nwrist in rowing and also passing between the men as they alternately\\nsit at the opposite gunwales to the leaded chocks or grooves in the\\nextreme pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size\\nof a common quill prevents it from slipping out from the chocks it\\nhangs in a slight festoon over the bows and is then passed inside the\\nboat again and some ten or twenty fathoms called boxline being\\ncoiled upon the box in the bows it continues its way to the gunwale\\nstill a little further aft and is then attached to the shortwarpthe\\nrope which is immediately connected with the harpoon but previous to\\nthat connexion the shortwarp goes through sundry mystifications too\\ntedious to detail\\n\\nthus the whaleline folds the whole boat in its complicated coils\\ntwisting and writhing around it in almost every direction all the\\noarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions so that to the timid\\neye of the landsman they seem as indian jugglers with the deadliest\\nsnakes sportively festooning their limbs nor can any son of mortal\\nwoman for the first time seat himself amid those hempen intricacies\\nand while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at any\\nunknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all these horrible\\ncontortions be put in play like ringed lightnings he cannot be thus\\ncircumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones\\nto quiver in him like a shaken jelly yet habitstrange thing what\\ncannot habit accomplishgayer sallies more merry mirth better jokes\\nand brighter

those\\nrepeated whaling disasterssome few of which are casually chronicledof\\nthis man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line and lost\\nfor when the line is darting out to be seated then in the boat is\\nlike being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a\\nsteamengine in full play when every flying beam and shaft and\\nwheel is grazing you it is worse for you cannot sit motionless in\\nthe heart of these perils because the boat is rocking like a cradle\\nand you are pitched one way and the other without the slightest\\nwarning and only by a certain selfadjusting buoyancy and\\nsimultaneousness of volition and action can you escape being made a\\nmazeppa of and run away with where the allseeing sun himself could\\nnever pierce you out\\n\\nagain as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and\\nprophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself\\nfor indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and\\ncontains it in itself as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal\\npowder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the\\nline as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought\\ninto actual playthis is a thing which carries more of true terror than\\nany other aspect of this dangerous affair but why say more all men\\nlive enveloped in whalelines all are born with halters round their\\nnecks but it is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death\\nthat mortals realize the silent subtle everpresent perils of life\\nand if you be a philosopher though seated in the whaleboat you would\\nnot at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seated before\\nyour evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by your side\\n\\n\\nchapter 61 stubb kills a

the same moment\\nsomething went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists it was\\nthe magical line an instant before stubb had swiftly caught two\\nadditional turns with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of its\\nincreased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and\\nmingled with the steady fumes from his pipe as the line passed round\\nand round the loggerhead so also just before reaching that point it\\nblisteringly passed through and through both of stubbs hands from\\nwhich the handcloths or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at\\nthese times had accidentally dropped it was like holding an enemys\\nsharp twoedged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time\\nstriving to wrest it out of your clutch\\n\\nwet the line wet the line cried stubb

whale all hands began pulling the boat up to him while\\nyet the boat was being towed on soon ranging up by his flank stubb\\nfirmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart\\ninto the flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately\\nsterning out of the way of the whales horrible wallow and then\\nranging up for another fling\\n\\nthe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down\\na hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which\\nbubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake the slanting sun\\nplaying upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflection\\ninto every face so that they all glowed to each other like red men\\nand all the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot\\nfrom the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the\\nmouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon his\\ncrooked lance by the line attached to it stubb straightened it again\\nand again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again and\\nagain sent it into the whale\\n\\npull uppull up he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whale\\nrelaxed in his wrath pull upclose to and the boat ranged along\\nthe fishs flank when reaching far over the bow stubb slowly churned\\nhis long sharp lance into the fish and kept it there carefully\\nchurning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold\\nwatch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful of\\nbreaking ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought was\\nthe innermost life of the fish and now it is struck for starting\\nfrom his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry the\\nmonster horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in\\nimpenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft\\ninstantly dropping astern had much ado blindly to struggle out from\\nthat phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day\\n\\nand now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into\\nview surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting\\nhis spouthole with sharp cracking agonized respirations at last\\ngush after gush of clotted red gore as if it had been the purple lees\\nof red wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again ran\\ndripping down his motionless flanks into the sea his heart had burst\\n\\nhes dead mr stubb said daggoo\\n\\nyes both pipes smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouth\\nstubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stood\\nthoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made\\n\\n\\nchapter 62 the dart\\n\\na word concerning an incident in the last chapter\\n\\naccording to the invariable usage of the fishery the whaleboat pushes\\noff from the ship with the headsman or whalekiller as temporary\\nsteersman and the harpooneer or whalefastener pulling the foremost\\noar the one known as the harpooneeroar now it needs a strong\\nnervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what\\nis called a long dart the heavy implement has to be flung to the\\ndistance of twenty or thirty feet but however prolonged and exhausting\\nthe chase the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the\\nuttermost indeed he is expected to set an example of superhuman\\nactivity to the rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeated\\nloud and intrepid exclamations and what it is to keep shouting at the\\ntop of ones compass while all the other muscles are strained and half\\nstartedwhat that is none know but those who have tried it for one i\\ncannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same\\ntime in this straining bawling state then with his back to the\\nfish all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting\\ncrystand up and give it to him he now has to drop and secure his\\noar turn round on his centre half way seize his harpoon from the\\ncrotch and with what little strength may remain he essays to pitch it\\nsomehow into the whale no wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen\\nin a body that out of fifty fair chances for a dart not five are\\nsuccessful no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed\\nand disrated no wonder that some of them actually burst their\\nbloodvessels in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen are\\nabsent four years with four barrels no wonder that to many ship\\nowners whaling is but a losing concern for it is the harpooneer that\\nmakes the voyage and if you take the breath out of his body how can\\nyou expect to find it there when most wanted\\n\\nagain if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant\\nthat is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneer\\nlikewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of\\nthemselves and every one else it is then they change places and the\\nheadsman the chief officer of the little craft takes his proper\\nstation in the bows of the boat\\n\\nnow i care not who maintains the contrary but all this is both\\nfoolish and unnecessary the headsman should stay in the bows from\\nfirst to last he should both dart the harpoon and the lance and no\\nrowing whatever should be expected of him except under circumstances\\nobvious to any fisherman i know that this would sometimes involve a\\nslight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in various\\nwhalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast\\nmajority of failures in the fishery it has not by any means been so\\nmuch the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the\\nharpooneer that has caused them\\n\\nto insure the greatest efficiency in the dart the harpooneers of this\\nworld must start to their feet from out of idleness and not from out\\nof toil\\n\\n\\nchapter 63 the crotch\\n\\nout of the trunk the branches grow out of them the twigs so in\\nproductive subjects grow the chapters\\n\\nthe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention\\nit is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two feet in length\\nwhich is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the\\nbow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of\\nthe harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly projects from the\\nprow thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler who\\nsnatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his\\nrifle from the wall it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in\\nthe crotch respectively called the first and second irons\\n\\nbut these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected with\\nthe line the object being this to dart them both if possible one\\ninstantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the\\ncoming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold it\\nis a doubling of the chances but it very often happens that owing to\\nthe instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon\\nreceiving the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer\\nhowever lightninglike in his movements to pitch the second iron into\\nhim nevertheless as the second iron is already connected with the\\nline and the line is running hence that weapon must at all events\\nbe anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else\\nthe most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands tumbled into the\\nwater it accordingly is in such cases the spare coils of box line\\nmentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instances\\nprudently practicable but this critical act is not always unattended\\nwith the saddest and most fatal casualties\\n\\nfurthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown\\noverboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharpedged terror\\nskittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the lines\\nor cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all directions\\nnor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is\\nfairly captured and a corpse\\n\\nconsider now how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging\\none unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to these\\nqualities in him as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of\\nsuch an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second irons may be\\nsimultaneously dangling about him for of course each boat is\\nsupplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first\\none be ineffectually darted without recovery all these particulars are\\nfaithfully narrated here as they will not fail to elucidate several\\nmost important however intricate passages in scenes hereafter to be\\npainted\\n\\n\\nchapter 64 stubbs supper\\n\\nstubbs whale had been killed some distance from the ship it was a\\ncalm so forming a tandem of three boats we commenced the slow\\nbusiness of towing the trophy to the pequod and now as we eighteen\\nmen with our thirtysix arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\\nfingers slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse\\nin the sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except at long\\nintervals good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of\\nthe mass we moved for upon the great canal of hangho or whatever\\nthey call it in china four or five laborers on the footpath will\\ndraw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this\\ngrand argosy we towed heavily forged along as if laden with piglead\\nin bulk\\n\\ndarkness came on but three lights up and down in the pequods\\nmainrigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw ahab\\ndropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks vacantly\\neyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders for\\nsecuring it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman\\nwent his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until\\nmorning\\n\\nthough in overseeing the pursuit of this whale captain ahab had\\nevinced his customary activity to call it so yet now that the\\ncreature was dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or\\ndespair seemed working in him as if the sight of that dead body\\nreminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain and though a thousand\\nother whales were brought to his ship all that would not one jot\\nadvance his grand monomaniac object very soon you would have thought\\nfrom the sound on the pequods decks that all hands were preparing to\\ncast anchor in the deep for heavy chains are being dragged along the\\ndeck and thrust rattling out of the portholes but by those clanking\\nlinks the vast corpse itself not the ship is to be moored tied by\\nthe head to the stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies\\nwith its black hull close to the vessels and seen through the darkness\\nof the night which obscured the spars and rigging aloft the twoship\\nand whale seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks whereof one\\nreclines while the other remains standing\\n\\na little item may as well be related here the strongest and most\\nreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside\\nis by the flukes or tail and as from its greater density that part is\\nrelatively heavier than any other excepting the sidefins its\\nflexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surface\\nso that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to\\nput the chain round it but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a\\nsmall strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end\\nand a weight in its middle while the other end is secured to the ship\\nby adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side\\nof the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readily\\nmade to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last\\nlocked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of\\njunction with its broad flukes or lobes\\n\\nif moody ahab was now all quiescence at least so far as could be known\\non deck stubb his second mate flushed with conquest betrayed an\\nunusual but still goodnatured excitement such an unwonted bustle was\\nhe in that the staid starbuck his official superior quietly resigned\\nto him for the time the sole management of affairs one small helping\\ncause of all this liveliness in stubb was soon made strangely\\nmanifest stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fond of\\nthe whale as a flavorish thing to his palate\\n\\na steak a steak ere i sleep you daggoo overboard you go and cut\\nme one from his small\\n\\nhere be it known that though these wild fishermen do not as a general\\nthing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray\\nthe current expenses of the war at least before realizing the proceeds\\nof the voyage yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers\\nwho have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale\\ndesignated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body\\n\\nabout midnight that steak was cut and cooked and lighted by two\\nlanterns of sperm oil stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper\\nat the capstanhead as if that capstan were a sideboard nor was stubb\\nthe only banqueter on whales flesh that night mingling their\\nmumblings with his own mastications thousands on thousands of sharks\\nswarming round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted on its fatness\\nthe few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp\\nslapping of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the\\nsleepers hearts peering over the side you could just see them as\\nbefore you heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and\\nturning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of\\nthe whale of the bigness of a human head this particular feat of the\\nshark seems all but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable\\nsurface they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remains\\na part of the universal problem of all things the mark they thus leave\\non the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in\\ncountersinking for a screw\\n\\nthough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a seafight sharks\\nwill be seen longingly gazing up to the ships decks like hungry dogs\\nround a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down every\\nkilled man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant\\nbutchers over the decktable are thus cannibally carving each others\\nlive meat with carvingknives all gilded and tasselled the sharks\\nalso with their jewelhilted mouths are quarrelsomely carving away\\nunder the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the\\nwhole affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thing\\nthat is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties\\nand though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships\\ncrossing the atlantic systematically trotting alongside to be handy\\nin case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slave to be\\ndecently buried and though one or two other like instances might be\\nset down touching the set terms places and occasions when sharks do\\nmost socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no\\nconceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless\\nnumbers and in gayer or more jovial spirits than around a dead sperm\\nwhale moored by night to a whaleship at sea if you have never seen\\nthat sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of\\ndevilworship and the expediency of conciliating the devil\\n\\nbut as yet stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was\\ngoing on so nigh him no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of\\nhis own epicurean lips\\n\\ncook cookwheres that old fleece he cried at length

creature that feeds his lamp and\\nlike stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so\\noutlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and\\nphilosophy of it\\n\\nit is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the right\\nwhale was esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded large\\nprices there also that in henry viiiths time a certain cook of the\\ncourt obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be\\neaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a species of\\nwhale porpoises indeed are to this day considered fine eating the\\nmeat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls and being\\nwell seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtleballs or veal balls\\nthe old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them they had a great\\nporpoise grant from the crown\\n\\nthe fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all\\nhands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but\\nwhen you come to sit down before a meatpie nearly one hundred feet\\nlong it takes away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of men\\nlike stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales but the esquimaux are\\nnot so fastidious we all know how they live upon whales and have rare\\nold vintages of prime old train oil zogranda one of their most famous\\ndoctors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedingly\\njuicy and nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishmen who\\nlong ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vesselthat\\nthese men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of\\nwhales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber among\\nthe dutch whalemen these scraps are called fritters which indeed\\nthey greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something\\nlike old amsterdam housewives doughnuts or olycooks when fresh\\nthey have such an eatable look that the most selfdenying stranger can\\nhardly keep his hands off\\n\\nbut what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his\\nexceeding richness he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be\\ndelicately good look at his hump which would be as fine eating as the\\nbuffalos which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solid\\npyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy that\\nis like the transparent halfjellied white meat of a cocoanut in the\\nthird month of its growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for\\nbutter nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into\\nsome other substance and then partaking of it in the long try watches\\nof the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their\\nshipbiscuit into the huge oilpots and let them fry there awhile many\\na good supper have i thus made\\n\\nin the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine\\ndish the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two\\nplump whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two large\\npuddings they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a most\\ndelectable mess in flavor somewhat resembling calves head which is\\nquite a dish among some epicures and every one knows that some young\\nbucks among the epicures by continually dining upon calves brains by\\nand by get to have a little brains of their own so as to be able to\\ntell a calfs head from their own heads which indeed requires\\nuncommon discrimination and that is the reason why a young buck with\\nan intelligent looking calfs head before him is somehow one of the\\nsaddest sights you can see the head looks a sort of reproachfully at\\nhim with an et tu brute expression\\n\\nit is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively\\nunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with\\nabhorrence that appears to result in some way from the consideration\\nbefore mentioned _ie_ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing\\nof the sea and eat it too by its own light but no doubt the first man\\nthat ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer perhaps he was\\nhung and if he had been put on his trial by oxen he certainly would\\nhave been and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does go to the\\nmeatmarket of a saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds\\nstaring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds does not that sight\\ntake a tooth out of the cannibals jaw cannibals who is not a\\ncannibal i tell you it will be more tolerable for the fejee that\\nsalted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine it\\nwill be more tolerable for that provident fejee i say in the day of\\njudgment than for thee civilized and enlightened gourmand who\\nnailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy\\npatédefoiegras\\n\\nbut stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is\\nadding insult to injury is it look at your knifehandle there my\\ncivilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is\\nthat handle made ofwhat but the bones of the brother of the very ox\\nyou are eating and what do you pick your teeth with after devouring\\nthat fat goose with a feather

society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but\\nsteel pens\\n\\n\\nchapter 66 the shark massacre\\n\\nwhen in the southern fishery a captured sperm whale after long and\\nweary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a general\\nthing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting\\nhim in for that business is an exceedingly laborious one is not very\\nsoon completed and requires all hands to set about it therefore the\\ncommon usage is to take in all sail lash the helm alee and then send\\nevery one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservation\\nthat until that time anchorwatches shall be kept that is two and\\ntwo for an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck\\nto see that all goes well\\n\\nbut sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific this plan will\\nnot answer at all because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather\\nround the moored carcase that were he left so for six hours say on a\\nstretch little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning in\\nmost other parts of the ocean however where these fish do not so\\nlargely abound their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably\\ndiminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whalingspades a\\nprocedure notwithstanding which in some instances only seems to\\ntickle them into still greater activity but it was not thus in the\\npresent case with the pequods sharks though to be sure any man\\nunaccustomed to such sights to have looked over her side that night\\nwould have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese and\\nthose sharks the maggots in it\\n\\nnevertheless upon stubb setting the anchorwatch after his supper was\\nconcluded and when accordingly queequeg and a forecastle seaman came\\non deck no small excitement was created among the sharks for\\nimmediately suspending the cutting stages over the side and lowering\\nthree lanterns so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid\\nsea these two mariners darting their long whalingspades kept up an\\nincessant murdering of the sharks by striking the keen steel deep\\ninto their skulls seemingly their only vital part but in the foamy\\nconfusion of their mixed and struggling hosts the marksmen could not\\nalways hit their mark and this brought about new revelations of the\\nincredible ferocity of the foe they viciously snapped not only at\\neach others disembowelments but like flexible bows bent round and\\nbit their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again\\nby the same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound nor was\\nthis all it was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these\\ncreatures a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in\\ntheir very joints and bones after what might be called the individual\\nlife had departed killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin\\none of these sharks almost took poor queequegs hand off when he tried\\nto shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw\\n\\nthe whalingspade used for cuttingin is made of the very best steel\\nis about the bigness of a mans spread hand and in general shape\\ncorresponds to the garden implement after which it is named only its\\nsides are perfectly flat and its upper end considerably narrower than\\nthe lower this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible and when\\nbeing used is occasionally honed just like a razor in its socket a\\nstiff pole from twenty to thirty feet long is inserted for a handle\\n\\nqueequeg no care what god made him

would\\nhave thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods\\n\\nin the first place the enormous cutting tackles among other ponderous\\nthings comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green and\\nwhich no single man can possibly liftthis vast bunch of grapes was\\nswayed up to the maintop and firmly lashed to the lower masthead the\\nstrongest point anywhere above a ships deck the end of the\\nhawserlike rope winding through these intricacies was then conducted\\nto the windlass and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over\\nthe whale to this block the great blubber hook weighing some one\\nhundred pounds was attached and now suspended in stages over the\\nside starbuck and stubb the mates armed with their long spades\\nbegan cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just\\nabove the nearest of the two sidefins this done a broad\\nsemicircular line is cut round the hole the hook is inserted and the\\nmain body of the crew striking up a wild chorus now commence heaving\\nin one dense crowd at the windlass when instantly the entire ship\\ncareens over on her side every bolt in her starts like the nailheads\\nof an old house in frosty weather she trembles quivers and nods her\\nfrighted mastheads to the sky more and more she leans over to the\\nwhale while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a\\nhelping heave from the billows till at last a swift startling snap\\nis heard with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from\\nthe whale and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it\\nthe disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber now as\\nthe blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange\\nso is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes\\nstripped by spiralizing it for the strain constantly kept up by the\\nwindlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the\\nwater and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the\\nline called the scarf simultaneously cut by the spades of starbuck\\nand stubb the mates and just as fast as it is thus peeled off and\\nindeed by that very act itself it is all the time being hoisted higher\\nand higher aloft till its upper end grazes the maintop the men at the\\nwindlass then cease heaving and for a moment or two the prodigious\\nblooddripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky and\\nevery one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings else\\nit may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard\\n\\none of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long keen weapon\\ncalled a boardingsword and watching his chance he dexterously slices\\nout a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass into\\nthis hole the end of the second alternating great tackle is then\\nhooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare for\\nwhat follows whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning all hands\\nto stand off once more makes a scientific dash at the mass and with a\\nfew sidelong desperate lunging slicings severs it completely in\\ntwain so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper\\nstrip called a blanketpiece swings clear and is all ready for\\nlowering the heavers forward now resume their song and while the one\\ntackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other\\nis slowly slackened away and down goes the first strip through the\\nmain hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the\\nblubberroom into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep\\ncoiling away the long blanketpiece as if it were a great live mass of\\nplaited serpents and thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoisting\\nand lowering simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the\\nheavers singing the blubberroom gentlemen coiling the mates\\nscarfing the ship straining and all hands swearing occasionally by\\nway of assuaging the general friction\\n\\n\\nchapter 68 the blanket\\n\\ni have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin\\nof the whale i have had controversies about it with experienced\\nwhalemen afloat and learned naturalists ashore my original opinion\\nremains unchanged but it is only an opinion\\n\\nthe question is what and where is the skin of the whale already you\\nknow what his blubber is that blubber is something of the consistence\\nof firm closegrained beef but tougher more elastic and compact and\\nranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness\\n\\nnow however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any\\ncreatures skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness yet\\nin point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption\\nbecause you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the\\nwhales body but that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layer\\nof any animal if reasonably dense what can that be but the skin\\ntrue from the unmarred dead body of the whale you may scrape off with\\nyour hand an infinitely thin transparent substance somewhat\\nresembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass only it is almost as\\nflexible and soft as satin that is previous to being dried when it\\nnot only contracts and thickens but becomes rather hard and brittle i\\nhave several such dried bits which i use for marks in my whalebooks\\nit is transparent as i said before and being laid upon the printed\\npage i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a\\nmagnifying influence at any rate it is pleasant to read about whales\\nthrough their own spectacles as you may say but what i am driving at\\nhere is this that same infinitely thin isinglass substance which i\\nadmit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be\\nregarded as the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so to\\nspeak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of\\nthe tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a\\nnewborn child but no more of this\\n\\nassuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin\\nas in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of one\\nhundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that in quantity\\nor rather weight that oil in its expressed state is only three\\nfourths and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence\\nbe had of the enormousness of that animated mass a mere part of whose\\nmere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that reckoning ten\\nbarrels to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of only three\\nquarters of the stuff of the whales skin\\n\\nin life the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among\\nthe many marvels he presents almost invariably it is all over\\nobliquely crossed and recrossed with numberless straight marks in\\nthick array something like those in the finest italian line\\nengravings but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the\\nisinglass substance above mentioned but seem to be seen through it as\\nif they were engraved upon the body itself nor is this all in some\\ninstances to the quick observant eye those linear marks as in a\\nveritable engraving but afford the ground for far other delineations\\nthese are hieroglyphical that is if you call those mysterious cyphers\\non the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics then that is the proper word to\\nuse in the present connexion by my retentive memory of the\\nhieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular i was much struck\\nwith a plate representing the old indian characters chiselled on the\\nfamous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper mississippi\\nlike those mystic rocks too the mysticmarked whale remains\\nundecipherable this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of another\\nthing besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm\\nwhale presents he not seldom displays the back and more especially\\nhis flanks effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance by\\nreason of numerous rude scratches altogether of an irregular random\\naspect i should say that those new england rocks on the seacoast\\nwhich agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact\\nwith vast floating icebergsi should say that those rocks must not a\\nlittle resemble the sperm whale in this particular it also seems to me\\nthat such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact\\nwith other whales for i have most remarked them in the large\\nfullgrown bulls of the species\\n\\na word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the\\nwhale it has already been said that it is stript from him in long\\npieces called blanketpieces like most seaterms this one is very\\nhappy and significant for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber\\nas in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an indian poncho\\nslipt over his head and skirting his extremity it is by reason of\\nthis cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keep\\nhimself comfortable in all weathers in all seas times and tides\\nwhat would become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy\\nseas of the north if unsupplied with his cosy surtout true other\\nfish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters but\\nthese be it observed are your coldblooded lungless fish whose very\\nbellies are refrigerators creatures that warm themselves under the\\nlee of an iceberg as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn\\nfire whereas like man the whale has lungs and warm blood freeze his\\nblood and he dies how wonderful is it thenexcept after\\nexplanationthat this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is as\\nindispensable as it is to man how wonderful that he should be found at\\nhome immersed to his lips for life in those arctic waters where when\\nseamen fall overboard they are sometimes found months afterwards\\nperpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice as a fly is\\nfound glued in amber but more surprising is it to know as has been\\nproved by experiment that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than\\nthat of a borneo negro in summer\\n\\nit does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong\\nindividual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rare\\nvirtue of interior spaciousness oh man admire and model thyself\\nafter the whale do thou too remain warm among ice do thou too\\nlive in this world without being of it be cool at the equator keep\\nthy blood fluid at the pole like the great dome of st peters and\\nlike the great whale retain o man in all seasons a temperature of\\nthine own\\n\\nbut how easy and how

tumultuous and bursting sea bear\\nin mind too that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut\\nmany feet deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without\\nso much as getting one

jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time\\nprevious when the pequod spoke the townho according to this account\\nand what was subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in\\nquestion had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the\\njeroboam his story was this\\n\\nhe had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna\\nshakers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secret\\nmeetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a\\ntrapdoor announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which he\\ncarried in his vestpocket but which instead of containing\\ngunpowder was supposed to be charged with laudanum a strange\\napostolic whim having seized him he had left neskyeuna for nantucket\\nwhere with that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steady\\ncommonsense exterior and offered himself as a greenhand candidate\\nfor the jeroboams whaling voyage they engaged him but straightway\\nupon the ships getting out of sight of land his insanity broke out in\\na freshet he announced himself as the archangel gabriel and commanded\\nthe captain to jump overboard he published his manifesto whereby he\\nset himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and\\nvicargeneral of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness with which\\nhe declared these thingsthe dark daring play of his sleepless\\nexcited imagination and all the preternatural terrors of real\\ndelirium united to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority of\\nthe ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover they\\nwere afraid of him as such a man however was not of much practical\\nuse in the ship especially as he refused to work except when he\\npleased the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him but\\napprised that that individuals intention was to land him in the first\\nconvenient port the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and\\nvialsdevoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition in\\ncase this intention was carried out so strongly did he work upon his\\ndisciples among the crew that at last in a body they went to the\\ncaptain and told him if gabriel was sent from the ship not a man of\\nthem would remain he was therefore forced to relinquish his plan nor\\nwould they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what he\\nwould so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom of\\nthe ship the consequence of all this was that the archangel cared\\nlittle or nothing for the captain and mates and since the epidemic had\\nbroken out he carried a higher hand than ever declaring that the\\nplague as he called it was at his sole command nor should it be\\nstayed but according to his good pleasure the sailors mostly poor\\ndevils cringed and some of them fawned before him in obedience to\\nhis instructions sometimes rendering him personal homage as to a god\\nsuch things may seem incredible but however wondrous they are true\\nnor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the\\nmeasureless selfdeception of the fanatic himself as his measureless\\npower of deceiving and bedevilling so many others but it is time to\\nreturn to the pequod\\n\\ni fear not thy epidemic man said ahab from the bulwarks to captain\\nmayhew who stood in the boats stern come on board\\n\\nbut now gabriel started to his feet\\n\\nthink think of the fevers yellow and bilious beware of the horrible\\nplague\\n\\ngabriel gabriel cried captain mayhew thou must either but that\\ninstant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethings\\ndrowned all speech\\n\\nhast thou seen the white whale demanded ahab when the boat drifted\\nback\\n\\nthink think of thy whaleboat stoven and sunk beware of the\\nhorrible tail\\n\\ni tell thee again gabriel that but again the boat tore ahead as if\\ndragged by fiends nothing was said for some moments while a\\nsuccession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those occasional\\ncaprices of the seas were tumbling not heaving it meantime the\\nhoisted sperm whales head jogged about very violently and gabriel was\\nseen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel\\nnature seemed to warrant\\n\\nwhen this interlude was over captain mayhew began a dark story\\nconcerning moby dick not however without frequent interruptions from\\ngabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed\\nleagued with him\\n\\nit seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home when upon speaking\\na whaleship her people were reliably apprised of the existence of\\nmoby dick and the havoc he had made greedily sucking in this\\nintelligence gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the\\nwhite whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering\\ninsanity pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the\\nshaker god incarnated the shakers receiving the bible but when some\\nyear or two afterwards moby dick was fairly sighted from the\\nmastheads macey the chief mate burned with ardour to encounter him\\nand the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\\nopportunity despite all the archangels denunciations and\\nforewarnings macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat\\nwith them he pushed off and after much weary pulling and many\\nperilous unsuccessful onsets he at last succeeded in getting one iron\\nfast meantime gabriel ascending to the mainroyal masthead was\\ntossing one arm in frantic gestures and hurling forth prophecies of\\nspeedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity now while\\nmacey the mate was standing up in his boats bow and with all the\\nreckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the\\nwhale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a\\nbroad white shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motion\\ntemporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen next\\ninstant the luckless mate so full of furious life was smitten bodily\\ninto the air and making a long arc in his descent fell into the sea\\nat the distance of about fifty yards not a chip of the boat was\\nharmed nor a hair of any oarsmans head but the mate for ever sank\\n\\nit is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in the\\nspermwhale fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any\\nsometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated\\noftener the boats bow is knocked off or the thighboard in which the\\nheadsman stands is torn from its place and accompanies the body but\\nstrangest of all is the circumstance that in more instances than one\\nwhen the body has been recovered not a single mark of violence is\\ndiscernible the man being stark dead\\n\\nthe whole calamity with the falling form of macey was plainly\\ndescried from the ship raising a piercing shriekthe vial the vial\\ngabriel called off the terrorstricken crew from the further hunting of\\nthe whale this terrible event clothed the archangel with added\\ninfluence because his credulous disciples believed that he had\\nspecifically foreannounced it instead of only making a general\\nprophecy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hit one\\nof many marks in the wide margin allowed he became a nameless terror\\nto the ship\\n\\nmayhew having concluded his narration ahab put such questions to him\\nthat the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he\\nintended to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to which\\nahab answeredaye straightway then gabriel once more started to\\nhis feet glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with\\ndownward pointed fingerthink think of the blasphemerdead and down\\ntherebeware of the blasphemers end\\n\\nahab stolidly turned aside then said to mayhew captain i have just\\nbethought me of my letterbag there is a letter for one of thy\\nofficers if i mistake not starbuck look over the bag\\n\\nevery whaleship takes out a goodly number of letters for various\\nships whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed\\ndepends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans\\nthus most letters never reach their mark and many are only received\\nafter attaining an age of two or three years or more\\n\\nsoon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand it was sorely\\ntumbled damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould in\\nconsequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin of such a\\nletter death himself might well have been the postboy\\n\\ncanst not read it cried ahab give it me man aye aye its but\\na dim scrawlwhats this as he was studying it out starbuck took a\\nlong cuttingspade pole and with his knife slightly split the end to\\ninsert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat without\\nits coming any closer to the ship\\n\\nmeantime ahab holding the letter muttered mr haryes mr harrya\\nwomans pinny handthe mans wife ill wagerayemr harry macey\\nship jeroboamwhy its macey and hes dead\\n\\npoor fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed mayhew but let\\nme have it\\n\\nnay keep it thyself cried gabriel to ahab thou art soon going\\nthat way\\n\\ncurses throttle thee yelled ahab captain mayhew stand by now to\\nreceive it and taking the fatal missive from starbucks hands he\\ncaught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the\\nboat but as he did so the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing\\nthe boat drifted a little towards the ships stern so that as if by\\nmagic the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriels eager hand he\\nclutched it in an instant seized the boatknife and impaling the\\nletter on it sent it thus loaded back into the ship it fell at ahabs\\nfeet then gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their\\noars and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the\\npequod\\n\\nas after this interlude the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket\\nof the whale many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild\\naffair\\n\\n\\nchapter 72 the monkeyrope\\n\\nin the tumultuous business of cuttingin and attending to a whale\\nthere is much running backwards and forwards among the crew now hands\\nare wanted here and then again hands are wanted there there is no\\nstaying in any one place for at one and the same time everything has\\nto be done everywhere it is much the same with him who endeavors the\\ndescription of the scene we must now retrace our way a little it was\\nmentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whales back the\\nblubberhook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the\\nspades of the mates but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that\\nsame hook get fixed in that hole it was inserted there by my\\nparticular friend queequeg whose duty it was as harpooneer to\\ndescend upon the monsters back for the special purpose referred to\\nbut in very many cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shall\\nremain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is\\nconcluded the whale be it observed lies almost entirely submerged\\nexcepting the immediate parts operated upon so down there some ten\\nfeet below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounders about\\nhalf on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves like\\na treadmill beneath him on the occasion in question queequeg figured\\nin the highland costumea shirt and socksin which to my eyes at\\nleast he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better\\nchance to observe him as will presently be seen\\n\\nbeing the savages bowsman that is the person who pulled the bowoar\\nin his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty to\\nattend upon him while taking that hardscrabble scramble upon the dead\\nwhales back you have seen italian organboys holding a dancingape by\\na long cord just so from the ships steep side did i hold queequeg\\ndown there in the sea by what is technically called in the fishery a\\nmonkeyrope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his\\nwaist\\n\\nit was a humorously perilous business for both of us for before we\\nproceed further it must be said that the monkeyrope was fast at both\\nends fast to queequegs broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow\\nleather one so that for better or for worse we two for the time\\nwere wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both\\nusage and honor demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should\\ndrag me down in his wake so then an elongated siamese ligature\\nunited us queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother nor could i\\nany way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond\\nentailed\\n\\nso strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then\\nthat while earnestly watching his motions i seemed distinctly to\\nperceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock\\ncompany of two that my free will had received a mortal wound and that\\nanothers mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited\\ndisaster and death therefore i saw that here was a sort of\\ninterregnum in providence for its evenhanded equity never could have\\nso gross an injustice and yet still further ponderingwhile i jerked\\nhim now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten\\nto jam himstill further pondering i say i saw that this situation of\\nmine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in\\nmost cases he one way or other has this siamese connexion with a\\nplurality of other mortals if your banker breaks you snap if your\\napothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills you die true\\nyou may say that by exceeding caution you may possibly escape these\\nand the multitudinous other evil chances of life but handle queequegs\\nmonkeyrope heedfully as i would sometimes he jerked it so that i\\ncame very near sliding overboard nor could i possibly forget that do\\nwhat i would i only had the management of one end of it\\n\\nthe monkeyrope is found in all whalers but it was only in the pequod\\nthat the monkey and his holder were ever tied together this\\nimprovement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man\\nthan stubb in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest\\npossible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his\\nmonkeyrope holder\\n\\ni have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the\\nwhale and the shipwhere he would occasionally fall from the incessant\\nrolling and swaying of both but this was not the only jamming jeopardy\\nhe was exposed to unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the\\nnight the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before\\npent blood which began to flow from the carcassthe rabid creatures\\nswarmed round it like bees in a beehive\\n\\nand right in among those sharks was queequeg who often pushed them\\naside with his floundering feet a thing altogether incredible were it\\nnot that attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise\\nmiscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man\\n\\nnevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a\\nravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to\\nthem accordingly besides the monkeyrope with which i now and then\\njerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what\\nseemed a peculiarly ferocious sharkhe was provided with still another\\nprotection suspended over the side in one of the stages tashtego and\\ndaggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen\\nwhalespades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could\\nreach this procedure of theirs to be sure was very disinterested and\\nbenevolent of them they meant queequegs best happiness i admit but\\nin their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that\\nboth he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the bloodmuddled\\nwater those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a\\nleg than a tail but poor queequeg i suppose straining and gasping\\nthere with that great iron hookpoor queequeg i suppose only prayed\\nto his yojo and gave up his life into the hands of his gods\\n\\nwell well my dear comrade and twinbrother thought i as i drew in\\nand then slacked off the rope to every swell of the seawhat matters\\nit after all are you not the precious image of each and all of us men\\nin this whaling world that unsounded ocean you gasp in is life those\\nsharks your foes those spades your friends and what between sharks\\nand spades you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad\\n\\nbut courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg for now\\nas with blue lips and bloodshot eyes the exhausted savage at last\\nclimbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily\\ntrembling over the side the steward advances and with a benevolent\\nconsolatory glance hands himwhat some hot cognac no hands him ye\\ngods hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water\\n\\nginger do i smell ginger suspiciously asked stubb coming near\\nyes this must be ginger peering into the as yet untasted cup then\\nstanding as if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towards the\\nastonished steward slowly saying ginger ginger and will you have\\nthe goodness to tell me mr doughboy where lies the virtue of\\nginger ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use doughboy to\\nkindle a fire in this shivering cannibal gingerwhat the devil is\\nginger seacoal firewoodlucifer matchestindergunpowderwhat\\nthe devil is ginger i

from forward will you look at that kannakin sir smell of it\\nif you please then watching the mates countenance he added the\\nsteward mr starbuck had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to\\nqueequeg there this instant off the whale is the steward an\\napothecary sir and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by\\nwhich he blows back the life into a halfdrowned man\\n\\ni trust not said starbuck it is poor stuff enough\\n\\naye aye steward cried stubb well teach you to drug a\\nharpooneer none of your apothecarys medicine here you want to poison\\nus do ye you have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder\\nus all and pocket the proceeds do ye\\n\\nit was not me cried doughboy it was aunt charity that brought the\\nginger on board and bade me never give

mr\\nstarbuck it is the captains ordersgrog for the harpooneer on a\\nwhale\\n\\nenough replied starbuck only dont hit him again but\\n\\noh i never hurt when i hit except when i hit a whale or something of\\nthat sort and this fellows a weazel what were you about saying\\nsir\\n\\nonly this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyself\\n\\nwhen stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a\\nsort of teacaddy in the other the first contained strong spirits and\\nwas handed to queequeg the second was aunt charitys gift and that\\nwas freely given to the waves\\n\\n\\nchapter 73 stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a talk\\nover him\\n\\nit must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whales\\nprodigious head hanging to the pequods side but we must let it\\ncontinue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to\\nit for the present other matters press and the best we can do now for\\nthe head is to pray heaven the tackles may hold\\n\\nnow during the past night and forenoon the pequod had gradually\\ndrifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow brit\\ngave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales a species of the\\nleviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking\\nanywhere near and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of\\nthose inferior creatures and though the pequod was not commissioned to\\ncruise for them at all and though she had passed numbers of them near\\nthe crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a sperm whale had\\nbeen brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all the\\nannouncement was made that a right whale should be captured that day\\nif opportunity offered\\n\\nnor was this long wanting tall spouts were seen to leeward and two\\nboats stubbs and flasks were detached in pursuit pulling further\\nand further away they at last became almost invisible to the men at\\nthe masthead but suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of\\ntumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or\\nboth the boats must be fast an interval passed and the boats were in\\nplain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the\\ntowing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at first\\nit seemed as if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a\\nmaelstrom within three rods of the planks he wholly disappeared from\\nview as if diving under the keel cut cut was the cry from the\\nship to the boats which for one instant seemed on the point of being\\nbrought with a deadly dash against the vessels side but having plenty\\nof line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly they\\npaid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their\\nmight so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minutes the struggle\\nwas intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened\\nline in one direction and still plied their oars in another the\\ncontending strain threatened to take them under but it was only a few\\nfeet advance they sought to gain and they stuck to it till they did\\ngain it when instantly a swift tremor was felt running like lightning\\nalong the keel as the strained line scraping beneath the ship\\nsuddenly rose to view under her bows snapping and quivering and so\\nflinging off its drippings that the drops fell like bits of broken\\nglass on the water while the whale beyond also rose to sight and once\\nmore the boats were free to fly but the fagged whale abated his speed\\nand blindly altering his course went round the stern of the ship\\ntowing the two boats after him so that they performed a complete\\ncircuit\\n\\nmeantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till close\\nflanking him on both sides stubb answered flask with lance for lance\\nand thus round and round the pequod the battle went while the\\nmultitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whales body\\nrushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinking at every\\nnew gash as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains\\nthat poured from the smitten rock\\n\\nat last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he\\nturned upon his back a corpse\\n\\nwhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes\\nand in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing some\\nconversation ensued between them\\n\\ni wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard said\\nstubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so\\nignoble a leviathan\\n\\nwants with it said flask coiling some spare line in the boats bow\\ndid you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whales\\nhead hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a right\\nwhales on the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship can\\nnever afterwards capsize\\n\\nwhy not\\n\\ni dont know but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so\\nand he seems to know all about ships charms but i sometimes think\\nhell charm the ship to no good at last i dont half like that chap\\nstubb did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved\\ninto a snakes head stubb\\n\\nsink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chance of a\\ndark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one by look\\ndown there flaskpointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both\\nhandsaye will i flask i take that fedallah to be the devil in\\ndisguise do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been\\nstowed away on board ship hes the devil i say the reason why you\\ndont see his tail is because he tucks it up out of sight he carries\\nit coiled away in his pocket i guess blast him now that i think of\\nit hes always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots\\n\\nhe sleeps in his boots dont he he hasnt got any hammock but ive\\nseen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging\\n\\nno doubt and its because of his cursed tail he coils it down do ye\\nsee in the eye of the rigging\\n\\nwhats the old man have so much to do with him for\\n\\nstriking up a swap or a bargain i suppose\\n\\nbargainabout what\\n\\nwhy do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale and\\nthe devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away\\nhis silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then\\nhell surrender moby dick\\n\\npooh stubb you are skylarking how can fedallah do that\\n\\ni dont know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked\\none i tell ye why they say as how he went a sauntering into the old\\nflagship once switching his tail about devilish easy and\\ngentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home well he\\nwas at home and asked the devil what he wanted the devil switching\\nhis hoofs up and says i want john what for says the old\\ngovernor what business is that of yours says the devil getting\\nmadi want to use him take him says the governorand by the\\nlord flask if the devil didnt give john the asiatic cholera before\\nhe got through with him ill eat this whale in one mouthful but look\\nsharpaint you all ready there well then pull ahead and lets get\\nthe whale alongside\\n\\ni think i remember some such story as you were telling said flask\\nwhen at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden\\ntowards the ship but i cant remember where\\n\\nthree spaniards adventures of those three bloodyminded soldadoes\\ndid ye read it there flask i guess ye did\\n\\nno never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell me\\nstubb do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now was\\nthe same you say is now on board the pequod\\n\\nam i the same man that helped kill this whale doesnt the devil live\\nfor ever who ever heard that the devil was dead did you ever see any\\nparson a wearing mourning for the devil and if the devil has a\\nlatchkey to get into the admirals cabin dont you suppose he can\\ncrawl into a porthole tell me that mr flask\\n\\nhow old do you suppose fedallah is stubb\\n\\ndo you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well thats\\nthe figure one now take all the hoops in the pequods hold and string\\nalong in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that\\nwouldnt begin to be fedallahs age nor all the coopers in creation\\ncouldnt show hoops enough to make oughts enough\\n\\nbut see here stubb i thought you a little boasted just now that you\\nmeant to give fedallah a seatoss if you got a good chance now if\\nhes so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he is going to\\nlive for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboardtell me\\nthat\\n\\ngive him a good ducking anyhow\\n\\nbut hed crawl back\\n\\nduck him again and keep ducking him\\n\\nsuppose he should take it into his head to duck you thoughyes and\\ndrown youwhat then\\n\\ni should like to see him try it id give him such a pair of black\\neyes that he wouldnt dare to show his face in the admirals cabin\\nagain for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he\\nlives and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much damn\\nthe devil flask so you suppose im afraid of the devil whos afraid\\nof him except the old governor who daresnt catch him and put him in\\ndoubledarbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnapping\\npeople aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil\\nkidnapped hed roast for him theres a governor\\n\\ndo you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab\\n\\ndo i suppose it youll know it before long flask but i am going now\\nto keep a sharp lookout on him and if i see anything very suspicious\\ngoing on ill just take him by the nape of his neck and saylook\\nhere beelzebub you dont do it and if he makes any fuss by the lord\\nill make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan\\nand give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come\\nshort off at the stumpdo you see and then i rather guess when he\\nfinds himself docked in that queer fashion hell sneak off without the\\npoor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs\\n\\nand what will you do with the tail stubb\\n\\ndo with it sell it for an ox whip when we get homewhat else\\n\\nnow do you mean what you say and have been saying all along stubb\\n\\nmean or not mean here we are at the ship\\n\\nthe boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard side\\nwhere fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for\\nsecuring him\\n\\ndidnt i tell you so said flask yes youll soon see this right\\nwhales head hoisted up opposite that parmacettis\\n\\nin good time flasks saying proved true as before the pequod steeply\\nleaned over towards the sperm whales head now by the counterpoise of\\nboth heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may\\nwell believe so when on one side you hoist in lockes head you go\\nover that way but now on the other side hoist in kants and you come\\nback again but in very poor plight thus some minds for ever keep\\ntrimming boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunderheads overboard\\nand then you will float light and right\\n\\nin disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the\\nship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the\\ncase of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut\\noff whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed\\nand hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to\\nwhat is called the crownpiece but nothing like this in the present\\ncase had been done the carcases of both whales had dropped astern\\nand the headladen ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair\\nof overburdening panniers\\n\\nmeantime fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whales head and ever\\nand anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own\\nhand and ahab chanced so to stand that the parsee occupied his\\nshadow while if the parsees shadow was there at all it seemed only\\nto blend with and lengthen ahabs as the crew toiled on laplandish\\nspeculations were bandied among them concerning all these passing\\nthings\\n\\n\\nchapter 74 the sperm whales headcontrasted view\\n\\nhere now are two great whales laying their heads together let us\\njoin them and lay together our own\\n\\nof the grand order of folio leviathans the sperm whale and the right\\nwhale are by far the most noteworthy they are the only whales\\nregularly hunted by man to the nantucketer they present the two\\nextremes of all the known varieties of the whale as the external\\ndifference between them is mainly observable in their heads and as a\\nhead of each is this moment hanging from the pequods side and as we\\nmay freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across the\\ndeckwhere i should like to know will you obtain a better chance to\\nstudy practical cetology than here\\n\\nin the first place you are struck by the general contrast between\\nthese heads both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a\\ncertain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whales which the right\\nwhales sadly lacks there is more character in the sperm whales head\\nas you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to\\nhim in point of pervading dignity in the present instance too this\\ndignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the\\nsummit giving token of advanced age and large experience in short he\\nis what the fishermen technically call a greyheaded whale\\n\\nlet us now note what is least dissimilar in these headsnamely the two\\nmost important organs the eye and the ear far back on the side of the\\nhead and low down near the angle of either whales jaw if you\\nnarrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would\\nfancy to be a young colts eye so out of all proportion is it to the\\nmagnitude of the head\\n\\nnow from this peculiar sideway position of the whales eyes it is\\nplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more\\nthan he can one exactly astern in a word the position of the whales\\neyes corresponds to that of a mans ears and you may fancy for\\nyourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objects\\nthrough your ears you would find that you could only command some\\nthirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight sideline of sight\\nand about thirty more behind it if your bitterest foe were walking\\nstraight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would not\\nbe able to see him any more than if he were stealing upon you from\\nbehind in a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the\\nsame time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makes\\nthe front of a manwhat indeed but his eyes\\n\\nmoreover while in most other animals that i can now think of the eyes\\nare so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power so as to\\nproduce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position of\\nthe whales eyes effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\\nsolid head which towers between them like a great mountain separating\\ntwo lakes in valleys this of course must wholly separate the\\nimpressions which each independent organ imparts the whale therefore\\nmust see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct\\npicture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and\\nnothingness to him man may in effect be said to look out on the\\nworld from a sentrybox with two joined sashes for his window but with\\nthe whale these two sashes are separately inserted making two\\ndistinct windows but sadly impairing the view this peculiarity of the\\nwhales eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and\\nto be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes\\n\\na curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\\nvisual matter as touching the leviathan but i must be content with a\\nhint so long as a mans eyes are open in the light the act of seeing\\nis involuntary that is he cannot then help mechanically seeing\\nwhatever objects are before him nevertheless any ones experience\\nwill teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of\\nthings at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively and\\ncompletely to examine any two thingshowever large or however smallat\\none and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side by side\\nand touch each other but if you now come to separate these two\\nobjects and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in\\norder to see one of them in such a manner as to bring your mind to\\nbear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\\nconsciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eyes in\\nthemselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more\\ncomprehensive combining and subtle than mans that he can at the\\nsame moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects one on\\none side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction if he\\ncan then is it as marvellous a thing in him as if a man were able\\nsimultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\\nproblems in euclid nor strictly investigated is there any\\nincongruity in this comparison\\n\\nit may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that the\\nextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\\nbeset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to queer\\nfrights so common to such whales i think that all this indirectly\\nproceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which their\\ndivided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them\\n\\nbut the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye if you are an\\nentire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two heads for\\nhours and never discover that organ the ear has no external leaf\\nwhatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so\\nwondrously minute is it it is lodged a little behind the eye with\\nrespect to their ears this important difference is to be observed\\nbetween the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former has\\nan external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered\\nover with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without\\n\\nis it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the\\nworld through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear\\nwhich is smaller than a hares but if his eyes were broad as the lens\\nof herschels great telescope and his ears capacious as the porches of\\ncathedrals would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of\\nhearing not at allwhy then do you try to enlarge your mind\\nsubtilize it\\n\\nlet us now with whatever levers and steamengines we have at hand cant\\nover the sperm whales head that it may lie bottom up then ascending\\nby a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not\\nthat the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we\\nmight descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach but\\nlet us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are what\\na really beautiful and chastelooking mouth from floor to ceiling\\nlined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy as\\nbridal satins\\n\\nbut come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems\\nlike the long narrow lid of an immense snuffbox with the hinge at one\\nend instead of one side if you pry it up so as to get it overhead\\nand expose its rows of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis and such\\nalas it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these\\nspikes fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to behold\\nwhen fathoms down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating there\\nsuspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen feet long hanging\\nstraight down at rightangles with his body for all the world like a\\nships jibboom this whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of\\nsorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of his\\njaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a\\nreproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lockjaws upon\\nhim\\n\\nin most cases this lower jawbeing easily unhinged by a practised\\nartistis disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting\\nthe ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone\\nwith which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles\\nincluding canes umbrellastocks and handles to ridingwhips\\n\\nwith a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an\\nanchor and when the proper time comessome few days after the other\\nworkqueequeg daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentists\\nare set to drawing teeth with a keen cuttingspade queequeg lances\\nthe gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle being\\nrigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as michigan oxen drag\\nstumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands there are generally\\nfortytwo teeth in all in old whales much worn down but undecayed\\nnor filled after our artificial fashion the jaw is afterwards sawn\\ninto slabs and piled away like joists for building houses\\n\\n\\nchapter 75 the right whales headcontrasted view\\n\\ncrossing the deck let us now have a good long look at the right\\nwhales head\\n\\nas in general shape the noble sperm whales head may be compared to a\\nroman warchariot especially in front where it is so broadly\\nrounded so at a broad view the right whales head bears a rather\\ninelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliottoed shoe two hundred\\nyears ago an old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a\\nshoemakers last and in this same last or shoe that old woman of the\\nnursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably be\\nlodged she and all her progeny\\n\\nbut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different\\naspects according to your point of view if you stand on its summit\\nand look at these two fshaped spoutholes you would take the whole\\nhead for an enormous bassviol and these spiracles the apertures in\\nits soundingboard then again if you fix your eye upon this strange\\ncrested comblike incrustation on the top of the massthis green\\nbarnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and the\\nsouthern fishers the bonnet of the right whale fixing your eyes\\nsolely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak\\nwith a birds nest in its crotch at any rate when you watch those\\nlive crabs that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almost\\nsure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy has been fixed by the\\ntechnical term crown also bestowed upon it in which case you will\\ntake great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a\\ndiademed king of the sea whose green crown has been put together for\\nhim in this marvellous manner but if this whale be a king he is a\\nvery sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem look at that hanging lower\\nlip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by\\ncarpenters measurement about twenty feet long and five feet deep a\\nsulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more\\n\\na great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be harelipped\\nthe fissure is about a foot across probably the mother during an\\nimportant interval was sailing down the peruvian coast when\\nearthquakes caused the beach to gape over this lip as over a slippery\\nthreshold we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i at\\nmackinaw i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam good\\nlord is this the road that jonah went the roof is about twelve feet\\nhigh and runs to a pretty sharp angle as if there were a regular\\nridgepole there while these ribbed arched hairy sides present us\\nwith those wondrous half vertical scimetarshaped slats of whalebone\\nsay three hundred on a side which depending from the upper part of the\\nhead or crown bone form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere\\nbeen cursorily mentioned the edges of these bones are fringed with\\nhairy fibres through which the right whale strains the water and in\\nwhose intricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed he goes\\nthrough the seas of brit in feeding time in the central blinds of\\nbone as they stand in their natural order there are certain curious\\nmarks curves hollows and ridges whereby some whalemen calculate the\\ncreatures age as the age of an oak by its circular rings though the\\ncertainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable yet it has the\\nsavor of analogical probability at any rate if we yield to it we\\nmust grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance\\nwill seem reasonable\\n\\nin old times there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies\\nconcerning these blinds one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous\\nwhiskers inside of the whales mouth another hogs bristles a\\nthird old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language\\nthere are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his\\nupper _chop_ which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth\\n\\nthis reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker or\\nrather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the\\nupper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometimes these tufts\\nimpart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn\\ncountenance\\n\\nas every one knows these same hogs bristles fins whiskers\\nblinds or whatever you please furnish to the ladies their busks and\\nother stiffening contrivances but in this particular the demand has\\nlong been on the decline it was in queen annes time that the bone was\\nin its glory the farthingale being then all the fashion and as those\\nancient dames moved about gaily though in the jaws of the whale as\\nyou may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we\\nnowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being a\\ntent spread over the same bone\\n\\nbut now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment and\\nstanding in the right whales mouth look around you afresh seeing all\\nthese colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you not\\nthink you were inside of the great haarlem organ and gazing upon its\\nthousand pipes for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest\\nturkeythe tongue which is glued as it were to the floor of the\\nmouth it is very fat and tender and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting\\nit on deck this particular tongue now before us at a passing glance i\\nshould say it was a sixbarreler that is it will yield you about that\\namount of oil\\n\\nere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started\\nwiththat the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely\\ndifferent heads to sum up then in the right whales there is no\\ngreat well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible\\nof a lower jaw like the sperm whales nor in the sperm whale are\\nthere any of those blinds of bone no huge lower lip and scarcely\\nanything of a tongue again the right whale has two external\\nspoutholes the sperm whale only one\\n\\nlook your last now on these venerable hooded heads while they yet\\nlie together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the other\\nwill not be very long in following\\n\\ncan you catch the expression of the sperm whales there it is the same\\nhe died with only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now\\nfaded away i think his broad brow to be full of a prairielike\\nplacidity born of a speculative indifference as to death but mark the\\nother heads expression see that amazing lower lip pressed by\\naccident against the vessels side so as firmly to embrace the jaw\\ndoes not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical\\nresolution in facing death this right whale i take to have been a\\nstoic the sperm whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza in\\nhis latter years\\n\\n\\nchapter 76 the batteringram\\n\\nere quitting for the nonce the sperm whales head i would have you\\nas a sensible physiologist simplyparticularly remark its front\\naspect in all its compacted collectedness i would have you\\ninvestigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some\\nunexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever batteringram power may\\nbe lodged there here is a vital point for you must either\\nsatisfactorily settle this matter with yourself or for ever remain an\\ninfidel as to one of the most appalling but not the less true events\\nperhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history\\n\\nyou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale\\nthe front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the\\nwater you observe that the lower part of that front slopes\\nconsiderably backwards so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long\\nsocket which receives the boomlike lower jaw you observe that the\\nmouth is entirely under the head much in the same way indeed as\\nthough your own mouth were entirely under your chin moreover you\\nobserve that the whale has no external nose and that what nose he\\nhashis spout holeis on the top of his head you observe that his eyes\\nand ears are at the sides of his head nearly one third of his entire\\nlength from the front wherefore you must now have perceived that the\\nfront of the sperm whales head is a dead blind wall without a single\\norgan or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore you are\\nnow to consider that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part\\nof the front of the head is there the slightest vestige of bone and\\nnot till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the\\nfull cranial development so that this whole enormous boneless mass is\\nas one wad finally though as will soon be revealed its contents\\npartly comprise the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprised\\nof the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that\\napparent effeminacy in some previous place i have described to you how\\nthe blubber wraps the body of the whale as the rind wraps an orange\\njust so with the head but with this difference about the head this\\nenvelope though not so thick is of a boneless toughness inestimable\\nby any man who has not handled it the severest pointed harpoon the\\nsharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm impotently rebounds\\nfrom it it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved\\nwith horses hoofs i do not think that any sensation lurks in it\\n\\nbethink yourself also of another thing when two large loaded indiamen\\nchance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks what do the\\nsailors do they do not suspend between them at the point of coming\\ncontact any merely hard substance like iron or wood no they hold\\nthere a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest and\\ntoughest of oxhide that bravely and uninjured takes the jam which\\nwould have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crowbars by\\nitself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at but\\nsupplementary to this it has hypothetically occurred to me that as\\nordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them\\ncapable at will of distension or contraction and as the sperm whale\\nas far as i know has no such provision in him considering too the\\notherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head\\naltogether beneath the surface and anon swims with it high elevated\\nout of the water considering the unobstructed elasticity of its\\nenvelope considering the unique interior of his head it has\\nhypothetically occurred to me i say that those mystical lungcelled\\nhoneycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and\\nunsuspected connexion with the outer air so as to be susceptible to\\natmospheric distension and contraction if this be so fancy the\\nirresistibleness of that might to which the most impalpable and\\ndestructive of all elements contributes\\n\\nnow mark unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable\\nwall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all a\\nmass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated as piled wood\\nisby the cord and all obedient to one volition as the smallest\\ninsect so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the\\nspecialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this\\nexpansive monster when i shall show you some of his more\\ninconsiderable braining feats i trust you will have renounced all\\nignorant incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though the\\nsperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mixed\\nthe atlantic with the pacific you would not elevate one hair of your\\neyebrow for unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and\\nsentimentalist in truth but clear truth is a thing for salamander\\ngiants only to encounter how small the chances for the provincials\\nthen what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddesss veil\\nat lais\\n\\n\\nchapter 77 the great heidelburgh tun\\n\\nnow comes the baling of the case but to comprehend it aright you must\\nknow something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated\\nupon\\n\\nregarding the sperm whales head as a solid oblong you may on an\\ninclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the lower\\nis the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an\\nunctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward end forming the\\nexpanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the middle of the\\nforehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two\\nalmost equal parts which before were naturally divided by an internal\\nwall of a thick tendinous substance\\n\\nquoin is not a euclidean term it belongs to the pure nautical\\nmathematics i know not that it has been defined before a quoin is a\\nsolid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the\\nsteep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both\\nsides\\n\\nthe lower subdivided part called the junk is one immense honeycomb of\\noil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousand\\ninfiltrated cells of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole\\nextent the upper part known as the case may be regarded as the great\\nheidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and as that famous great tierce is\\nmystically carved in front so the whales vast plaited forehead forms\\ninnumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his\\nwondrous tun moreover as that of heidelburgh was always replenished\\nwith the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys so the tun\\nof the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily\\nvintages namely the highlyprized spermaceti in its absolutely pure\\nlimpid and odoriferous state nor is this precious substance found\\nunalloyed in any other part of the creature though in life it remains\\nperfectly fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death it soon\\nbegins to concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots as when\\nthe first thin delicate ice is just forming in water a large whales\\ncase generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm though from\\nunavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks and\\ndribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish\\nbusiness of securing what you can\\n\\ni know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun was\\ncoated within but in superlative richness that coating could not\\npossibly have compared with the silken pearlcoloured membrane like\\nthe lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the sperm\\nwhales case\\n\\nit will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale\\nembraces the entire length of the entire top of the head and sinceas\\nhas been elsewhere set forththe head embraces one third of the whole\\nlength of the creature then setting that length down at eighty feet\\nfor a good sized whale you have more than twentysix feet for the\\ndepth of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a\\nships side\\n\\nas in decapitating the whale the operators instrument is brought\\nclose to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the\\nspermaceti magazine he has therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest\\na careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly\\nlet out its invaluable contents it is this decapitated end of the\\nhead also which is at last elevated out of the water and retained in\\nthat position by the enormous cutting tackles whose hempen\\ncombinations on one side make quite a wilderness of ropes in that\\nquarter\\n\\nthus much being said attend now i pray you to that marvellous andin\\nthis particular instancealmost fatal operation whereby the sperm\\nwhales great heidelburgh tun is

like a treasurehunter in some old house\\nsounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in by the time\\nthis cautious search is over a stout ironbound bucket precisely like\\na wellbucket has been attached to one end of the whip while the\\nother end being stretched across the deck is there held by two or\\nthree alert hands these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the\\nindian to whom another person has reached up a very long pole\\ninserting this pole into the bucket tashtego downward guides the\\nbucket into the tun till it entirely disappears then giving the word\\nto the seamen at the whip up comes the bucket again all bubbling like\\na dairymaids pail of new milk carefully lowered from its height the\\nfullfreighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quickly\\nemptied into a large tub then remounting aloft it again goes through\\nthe same round until the deep cistern will yield no more towards the\\nend tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder and deeper\\nand deeper into the tun until some twenty feet of the pole have gone\\ndown\\n\\nnow the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way\\nseveral tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all at once\\na queer accident happened whether it was that tashtego that wild\\nindian was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his\\nonehanded hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head or\\nwhether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy or\\nwhether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so without\\nstating his particular reasons how it was exactly there is no telling\\nnow but on a sudden as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came\\nsuckingly upmy god poor tashtegolike the twin reciprocating bucket\\nin a veritable well dropped headforemost down into this great tun of\\nheidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling went clean out of\\nsight\\n\\nman overboard cried daggoo who amid the general consternation first\\ncame to his senses swing the bucket this way and putting one foot\\ninto it so as the better to secure his slippery handhold on the whip\\nitself the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head almost\\nbefore tashtego could have reached its interior bottom meantime there\\nwas a terrible tumult looking over the side they saw the before\\nlifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea\\nas if that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it was only\\nthe poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous\\ndepth to which he had sunk\\n\\nat this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head was clearing\\nthe whipwhich had somehow got foul of the great cutting tacklesa\\nsharp cracking noise was heard and to the unspeakable horror of all\\none of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out and with a\\nvast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk ship\\nreeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg the one remaining hook\\nupon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to be\\non the point of giving way an event still more likely from the violent\\nmotions of the head\\n\\ncome down come down yelled the seamen to daggoo but with one hand\\nholding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head should drop he\\nwould still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul line\\nrammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the\\nburied harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out\\n\\nin heavens name man cried stubb are you ramming home a cartridge\\nthereavast how will that help him jamming that ironbound bucket on\\ntop of his head avast will ye\\n\\nstand clear of the tackle cried a voice like the bursting of a\\nrocket\\n\\nalmost in the same instant with a thunderboom the enormous mass\\ndropped into the sea like niagaras tablerock into the whirlpool the\\nsuddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glittering\\ncopper and all caught their breath as half swingingnow over the\\nsailors heads and now over the waterdaggoo through a thick mist of\\nspray was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles while poor\\nburiedalive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the\\nsea but hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away when a naked\\nfigure with a boardingsword in his hand was for one swift moment seen\\nhovering over the bulwarks the next a loud splash announced that my\\nbrave queequeg had dived to the rescue one packed rush was made to the\\nside and every eye counted every ripple as moment followed moment\\nand no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen some hands\\nnow jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little off from the\\nship\\n\\nha ha cried daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perch\\noverhead and looking further off from the side we saw an arm thrust\\nupright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an arm thrust\\nforth from the grass over a grave\\n\\nboth bothit is bothcried daggoo again with a joyful shout and\\nsoon after queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand and\\nwith the other clutching the long hair of the indian drawn into the\\nwaiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but tashtego was\\nlong in coming to and queequeg did not look very brisk\\n\\nnow how had this noble rescue been accomplished why diving after the\\nslowly descending head queequeg with his keen sword had made side\\nlunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then\\ndropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards\\nand so hauled out poor tash by the head he averred that upon first\\nthrusting in for him a leg was presented but well knowing that that\\nwas not as it ought to be and might occasion great troublehe had\\nthrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought a\\nsomerset upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth in\\nthe good old wayhead foremost as for the great head itself that was\\ndoing as well as could be expected\\n\\nand thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\\nqueequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego was\\nsuccessfully accomplished in the teeth too of the most untoward and\\napparently hopeless impediments which is a lesson by no means to be\\nforgotten midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing\\nand boxing riding and rowing\\n\\ni know that this queer adventure of the gayheaders will be sure to\\nseem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may have\\neither seen or heard of some ones falling into a cistern ashore an\\naccident which not seldom happens and with much less reason too than\\nthe indians considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the\\nsperm whales well\\n\\nbut peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this we thought\\nthe tissued infiltrated head of the sperm whale was the lightest and\\nmost corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element of\\na far greater specific gravity than itself we have thee there not at\\nall but i have ye for at the time poor tash fell in the case had\\nbeen nearly emptied of its lighter contents leaving little but the\\ndense tendinous wall of the wella double welded hammered substance\\nas i have before said much heavier than the sea water and a lump of\\nwhich sinks in it like lead almost but the tendency to rapid sinking\\nin this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted\\nby the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it so that it\\nsank very slowly and deliberately indeed affording queequeg a fair\\nchance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run as you may say\\nyes it was a running delivery so it was\\n\\nnow had tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious\\nperishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant\\nspermaceti

characteristics of other beings than man therefore\\nthough i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of\\nthese two semisciences to the whale i will do my endeavor i try all\\nthings i achieve what i can\\n\\nphysiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous creature he\\nhas no proper nose and since the nose is the central and most\\nconspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies and\\nfinally controls their combined expression hence it would seem that\\nits entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect\\nthe countenance of the whale for as in landscape gardening a spire\\ncupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable\\nto the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in\\nkeeping without the elevated openwork belfry of the nose dash the\\nnose from phidiass marble jove and what a sorry remainder\\nnevertheless leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his\\nproportions are so stately that the same deficiency which in the\\nsculptured jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all nay it is\\nan added grandeur a nose to the whale would have been impertinent as\\non your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your\\njollyboat your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the\\nreflection that he has a nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit which\\nso often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest\\nroyal beadle on his throne\\n\\nin some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to\\nbe had of the sperm whale is that of the full front of his head this\\naspect is sublime\\n\\nin thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the\\nmorning in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull has\\na touch of the grand in it pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles\\nthe elephants brow is majestic human or animal the mystical brow is\\nas that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to their\\ndecrees it signifiesgod done this day by my hand but in most\\ncreatures nay in man himself very often the brow is but a mere strip\\nof alpine land lying along the snow line few are the foreheads which\\nlike shakespeares or melancthons rise so high and descend so low\\nthat the eyes themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lakes\\nand all above them in the foreheads wrinkles you seem to track the\\nantlered thoughts descending there to drink as the highland hunters\\ntrack the snow prints of the deer but in the great sperm whale this\\nhigh and mighty godlike dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely\\namplified that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the\\ndeity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other\\nobject in living nature for you see no one point precisely not one\\ndistinct feature is revealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no face\\nhe has none proper nothing but that one broad firmament of a\\nforehead pleated with riddles dumbly lowering with the doom of boats\\nand ships and men nor in profile does this wondrous brow diminish\\nthough that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so in\\nprofile you plainly perceive that horizontal semicrescentic\\ndepression in the foreheads middle which in man is lavaters mark\\nof genius\\n\\nbut how genius in the sperm whale has the sperm whale ever written a\\nbook spoken a speech no his great genius is declared in his doing\\nnothing particular to prove it it is moreover declared in his\\npyramidical silence and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale\\nbeen known to the young orient world he would have been deified by\\ntheir childmagian thoughts they deified the crocodile of the nile\\nbecause the crocodile is tongueless and the sperm whale has no tongue\\nor at least it is so exceedingly small as to be incapable of\\nprotrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall\\nlure back to their birthright the merry mayday gods of old and\\nlivingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now\\nunhaunted hill then be sure exalted to joves high seat the great\\nsperm whale shall lord

and the side view of this skull is as\\nthe side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level\\nbase but in lifeas we have elsewhere seenthis inclined plane is\\nangularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent\\nmass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skull forms a crater to\\nbed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this craterin\\nanother cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in\\ndepthreposes the mere handful of this monsters brain the brain is at\\nleast twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden away\\nbehind its vast outworks like the innermost citadel within the\\namplified fortifications of quebec so like a choice casket is it\\nsecreted in him that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny\\nthat the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance\\nof one formed by the cubicyards of his sperm magazine lying in\\nstrange folds courses and convolutions to their apprehensions it\\nseems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that\\nmystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence\\n\\nit is plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in\\nthe creatures living intact state is an entire delusion as for his\\ntrue brain you can then see no indications of it nor feel any the\\nwhale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the\\ncommon world\\n\\nif you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view\\nof its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by its\\nresemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from\\nthe same point of view indeed place this reversed skull scaled down\\nto the human magnitude among a plate of mens skulls and you would\\ninvoluntarily confound it with them and remarking the depressions on\\none part of its summit in phrenological phrase you would saythis man\\nhad no selfesteem and no veneration and by those negations\\nconsidered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and\\npower you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most\\nexhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is\\n\\nbut if from the comparative dimensions of the whales proper brain you\\ndeem it incapable of being adequately charted then i have another idea\\nfor you if you attentively regard almost any quadrupeds spine you\\nwill be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung\\nnecklace of dwarfed skulls all bearing rudimental resemblance to the\\nskull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebræ are absolutely\\nundeveloped skulls but the curious external resemblance i take it the\\ngermans were not the first men to perceive a foreign friend once\\npointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with\\nthe vertebræ of which he was inlaying in a sort of bassorelievo the\\nbeaked prow of his canoe now i consider that the phrenologists have\\nomitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the\\ncerebellum through the spinal canal for i believe that much of a mans\\ncharacter will be found betokened in his backbone i would rather feel\\nyour spine than your skull whoever you are a thin joist of a spine\\nnever yet upheld a full and noble soul i rejoice in my spine as in\\nthe firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to the\\nworld\\n\\napply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale his cranial\\ncavity is continuous with the first neckvertebra and in that vertebra\\nthe bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across being\\neight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards as\\nit passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size but\\nfor a considerable distance remains of large capacity now of course\\nthis canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substancethe\\nspinal cordas the brain and directly communicates with the brain and\\nwhat is still more for many feet after emerging from the brains\\ncavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost equal\\nto that of the brain under all these circumstances would it be\\nunreasonable to survey and map out the whales spine phrenologically\\nfor viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of his\\nbrain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative\\nmagnitude of his spinal cord\\n\\nbut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists i\\nwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the\\nsperm whales hump this august hump if i mistake not rises over one\\nof the larger vertebræ and is therefore in some sort the outer\\nconvex mould of it from its relative situation then i should call\\nthis high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm\\nwhale and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have\\nreason to know\\n\\n\\nchapter

giving a sudden gasp he\\ntumultuously sounded with a grating rush the three lines flew round\\nthe loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them\\nwhile so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would\\nsoon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous might they\\ncaught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till at\\nlastowing to the perpendicular strain from the leadlined chocks of\\nthe boats whence the three ropes went straight down into the bluethe\\ngunwales of the bows were almost even with the water while the three\\nsterns tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound for\\nsome time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more\\nline though the position was a little ticklish but though boats have\\nbeen taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on as\\nit is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from\\nthe back this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon rising\\nagain to meet the sharp lance of his foes yet not to speak of the\\nperil of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is always\\nthe best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the\\nstricken whale stays under water the more he is exhausted because\\nowing to the enormous surface of himin a full grown sperm whale\\nsomething less than 2000 square feetthe pressure of the water is\\nimmense we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we\\nourselves stand up under even here aboveground in the air how\\nvast then the burden of a whale bearing on his back a column of two\\nhundred fathoms of ocean it must at least equal the weight of fifty\\natmospheres one whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty\\nlineofbattle ships with all their guns and stores and men on\\nboard\\n\\nas the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down\\ninto its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any\\nsort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths\\nwhat landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and\\nplacidity the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in\\nagony not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows\\nseems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathan\\nwas suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended and\\nto what to three bits of board is this the creature of whom it was\\nonce so triumphantly saidcanst thou fill his skin with barbed irons\\nor his head with fishspears the sword of him that layeth at him\\ncannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron\\nas straw the arrow cannot make him flee darts are counted as stubble\\nhe laugheth at the shaking of a spear this the creature this he oh\\nthat unfulfilments should follow the prophets for with the strength of\\na thousand thighs in his tail leviathan had run his head under the\\nmountains of the sea to hide him from the pequods fishspears\\n\\nin that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadows that the three boats\\nsent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad\\nenough to shade half xerxes army who can tell how appalling to the\\nwounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head\\n\\nstand by men he stirs cried starbuck as the three lines suddenly\\nvibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them as by\\nmagnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every\\noarsman felt them in his seat the next moment relieved in great part\\nfrom the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounce\\nupwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bears are\\nscared from it into the sea\\n\\nhaul in haul in cried starbuck again hes rising\\n\\nthe lines of which hardly an instant before not one hands breadth\\ncould have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back all\\ndripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within two\\nships lengths of the hunters\\n\\nhis motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most land\\nanimals there are certain valves or floodgates in many of their veins\\nwhereby when wounded the blood is in some degree at least instantly\\nshut off in certain directions not so with the whale one of whose\\npeculiarities it is to have an entire nonvalvular structure of the\\nbloodvessels so that when pierced even by so small a point as a\\nharpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial\\nsystem and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of\\nwater at a great distance below the surface his life may be said to\\npour from him in incessant streams yet so vast is the quantity of\\nblood in him and so distant and numerous its interior fountains that\\nhe will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period even\\nas in a drought a river will flow whose source is in the wellsprings\\nof faroff and undiscernible hills even now when the boats pulled\\nupon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying flukes and the\\nlances were darted into him they were followed by steady jets from the\\nnew made wound which kept continually playing while the natural\\nspouthole in his head was only at intervals however rapid sending\\nits affrighted moisture into the air from this last vent no blood yet\\ncame because no vital part of him had thus far been struck his life\\nas they significantly call it was untouched\\n\\nas the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of\\nhis form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainly\\nrevealed his eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were\\nbeheld as strange misgrown masses gather in the knotholes of the\\nnoblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whales eyes\\nhad once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see\\nbut pity there was none for all his old age and his one arm and his\\nblind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in order to light\\nthe gay bridals and other merrymakings of men and also to illuminate\\nthe solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to\\nall still rolling in his blood at last he partially disclosed a\\nstrangely discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low\\ndown on the flank\\n\\na nice spot cried flask just let me prick him there once\\n\\navast cried starbuck theres no need of that\\n\\nbut humane starbuck was too late at the instant of the dart an\\nulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more\\nthan sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift\\nfury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying\\ncrews all over with showers of gore capsizing flasks boat and marring\\nthe bows it was his death stroke for by this time so spent was he\\nby loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had\\nmade lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin\\nthen over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up the\\nwhite secrets of his belly lay like a log and died it was most\\npiteous that last expiring spout as when by unseen hands the water is\\ngradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with halfstifled\\nmelancholy gurglings the spraycolumn lowers and lowers to the\\ngroundso the last long dying spout of the whale\\n\\nsoon while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body\\nshowed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled\\nimmediately by starbucks orders lines were secured to it at\\ndifferent points so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken\\nwhale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords by very\\nheedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale was transferred\\nto her side and was strongly secured there by the stiffest\\nflukechains for it was plain that unless artificially upheld the\\nbody would at once sink to the bottom\\n\\nit so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade\\nthe entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his\\nflesh on the lower part of the bunch before described but as the\\nstumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured\\nwhales with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence\\nof any kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have\\nbeen some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for\\nthe ulceration alluded to but still more curious was the fact of a\\nlancehead of stone being found in him not far from the buried iron\\nthe flesh perfectly firm about it who had darted that stone lance and\\nwhen it might have been darted by some nor west indian long before\\namerica was discovered\\n\\nwhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\\ncabinet there is no telling but a sudden stop was put to further\\ndiscoveries by the ships being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways\\nto the sea owing to the bodys immensely increasing tendency to sink\\nhowever starbuck who had the ordering of affairs hung on to it to\\nthe last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at length the\\nship would have been capsized if still persisting in locking arms with\\nthe body then when the command was given to break clear from it such\\nwas the immovable strain upon the timberheads to which the\\nflukechains and cables were fastened that it was impossible to cast\\nthem off meantime everything in the pequod was aslant to cross to the\\nother side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a\\nhouse the ship groaned and gasped many of the ivory inlayings of her\\nbulwarks and cabins were started from their places by the unnatural\\ndislocation in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the\\nimmovable flukechains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so\\nlow had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at\\nall approached while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed\\nadded to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going\\nover\\n\\nhold on hold on wont ye cried stubb to the body dont be in\\nsuch a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do something\\nor go for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspikes\\nand run one of ye for a prayer book and a penknife and cut the big\\nchains\\n\\nknife aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the carpenters heavy\\nhatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing\\nat the largest flukechains but a few strokes full of sparks were\\ngiven when the exceeding strain effected the rest with a terrific\\nsnap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank\\n\\nnow this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm\\nwhale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yet adequately\\naccounted for it usually the dead sperm whale floats with great\\nbuoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\\nsurface if the only whales that thus sank were old meagre and\\nbrokenhearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all their\\nbones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that\\nthis sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so\\nsinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but it\\nis not so for young whales in the highest health and swelling with\\nnoble aspirations prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of\\nlife with all their panting lard about them even these brawny\\nbuoyant heroes do sometimes sink\\n\\nbe it said however that the sperm whale is far less liable to this\\naccident than any other species where one of that sort go down twenty\\nright whales do this difference in the species is no doubt imputable\\nin no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale\\nhis venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this\\nincumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free but there are instances\\nwhere after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whale\\nagain rises more buoyant than in life but the reason of this is\\nobvious gases are generated in him he swells to a prodigious\\nmagnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a lineofbattle ship\\ncould hardly keep him under then in the shore whaling on soundings\\namong the bays of new zealand when a right whale gives token of\\nsinking they fasten buoys to him with plenty of rope so that when\\nthe body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shall\\nhave ascended again\\n\\nit was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from\\nthe pequods mastheads announcing that the jungfrau was again\\nlowering her boats though the only spout in sight was that of a\\nfinback belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because of\\nits incredible power of swimming nevertheless the finbacks spout is\\nso similar to the sperm whales that by unskilful fishermen it is\\noften mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host were\\nnow in valiant chase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowding all\\nsail made after her four young keels and thus they all disappeared\\nfar to leeward still in bold hopeful chase\\n\\noh

chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together and\\noften stand for each other thou art as a lion of the waters and as a\\ndragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in\\ntruth some versions of the bible use that word itself besides it\\nwould much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st george but\\nencountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle\\nwith the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but only\\na perseus a st george a coffin have the heart in them to march\\nboldly up to a whale\\n\\nlet not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us for though the\\ncreature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely\\nrepresented of a griffinlike shape and though the battle is depicted\\non land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignorance\\nof those times when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists\\nand considering that as in perseus case st georges whale might have\\ncrawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animal\\nridden by st george might have been only a large seal or seahorse\\nbearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible\\nwith the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene to\\nhold this socalled dragon no other than the great leviathan himself\\nin fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole story\\nwill fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistines\\ndagon by name who being planted before the ark of israel his horses\\nhead and both the palms of his hands fell off from him and only the\\nstump or fishy part of him remained thus then one of our own noble\\nstamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and by\\ngood rights we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most\\nnoble order of st george and therefore let not the knights of that\\nhonorable company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to do\\nwith a whale like their great patron let them never eye a nantucketer\\nwith disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we\\nare much better entitled to st georges decoration than they\\n\\nwhether to admit hercules among us or not concerning this i long\\nremained dubious for though according to the greek mythologies that\\nantique crockett and kit carsonthat brawny doer of rejoicing good\\ndeeds was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether that\\nstrictly makes a whaleman of him that might be mooted it nowhere\\nappears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unless indeed from\\nthe inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary\\nwhaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i\\nclaim him for one of our clan\\n\\nbut by the best contradictory authorities this grecian story of\\nhercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more\\nancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice versâ certainly\\nthey are very similar if i claim the demigod then why not the\\nprophet\\n\\nnor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprise the whole\\nroll of our order our grand master is still to be named for like\\nroyal kings of old times we find the head waters of our fraternity in\\nnothing short of the great gods themselves that wondrous oriental\\nstory is now to be rehearsed from the shaster which gives us the dread\\nvishnoo one of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos gives\\nus this divine vishnoo himself for our lordvishnoo who by the first\\nof his ten earthly incarnations has for ever set apart and sanctified\\nthe whale when brahma or the god of gods saith the shaster resolved\\nto recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions he gave\\nbirth to vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical\\nbooks whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo\\nbefore beginning the creation and which therefore must have contained\\nsomething in the shape of practical hints to young architects these\\nvedas were lying at the bottom of the waters so vishnoo became\\nincarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths\\nrescued the sacred volumes was not this vishnoo a whaleman then even\\nas a man who rides a horse is called a horseman\\n\\nperseus st george hercules jonah and vishnoo theres a\\nmemberroll for you what club but the whalemans can head off like\\nthat\\n\\n\\nchapter 83 jonah historically regarded\\n\\nreference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in\\nthe preceding chapter now some nantucketers rather distrust this\\nhistorical story of jonah and the whale but then there were some\\nsceptical greeks and romans who standing out from the orthodox pagans\\nof their times equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale\\nand arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those traditions did\\nnot make those traditions one whit the less facts for all that\\n\\none old sagharbor whalemans chief reason for questioning the hebrew\\nstory was thishe had one of those quaint oldfashioned bibles\\nembellished with curious unscientific plates one of which represented\\njonahs whale with two spouts in his heada peculiarity only true with\\nrespect to a species of the leviathan the right whale and the\\nvarieties of that order concerning which the fishermen have this\\nsaying a penny roll would choke him his swallow is so very small\\nbut to this bishop jebbs anticipative answer is ready it is not\\nnecessary hints the bishop that we consider jonah as tombed in the\\nwhales belly but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth and\\nthis seems reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the right\\nwhales mouth would accommodate a couple of whisttables and\\ncomfortably seat all the players possibly too jonah might have\\nensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thoughts the right\\nwhale is toothless\\n\\nanother reason which sagharbor he went by that name urged for his\\nwant of faith in this matter of the prophet was something obscurely in\\nreference to his incarcerated body and the whales gastric juices but\\nthis objection likewise falls to the ground because a german exegetist\\nsupposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a\\n_dead_ whaleeven as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turned\\ntheir dead horses into tents and crawled into them besides it has\\nbeen divined by other continental commentators that when jonah was\\nthrown overboard from the joppa ship he straightway effected his\\nescape to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a\\nfigurehead and i would add possibly called the whale as some\\ncraft are nowadays christened the shark the gull the eagle nor\\nhave there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the\\nwhale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a lifepreserveran\\ninflated bag of windwhich the endangered prophet swam to and so was\\nsaved from a watery doom poor sagharbor therefore seems worsted all\\nround but he had still another reason for his want of faith it was\\nthis if i remember right jonah was swallowed by the whale in the\\nmediterranean sea and after three days he was vomited up somewhere\\nwithin three days journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much\\nmore than three days journey across from the nearest point of the\\nmediterranean coast how is that\\n\\nbut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within\\nthat short distance of nineveh yes he might have carried him round by\\nthe way of the cape of good hope but not to speak of the passage\\nthrough the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage up\\nthe persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve the\\ncomplete circumnavigation of all africa in three days not to speak of\\nthe tigris waters near the site of nineveh being too shallow for any\\nwhale to swim in besides this idea of jonahs weathering the cape of\\ngood hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of\\nthat great headland from bartholomew diaz its reputed discoverer and\\nso make modern history a liar\\n\\nbut all these foolish arguments of old sagharbor only evinced his\\nfoolish pride of reasona thing still more reprehensible in him seeing\\nthat he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the\\nsun and the sea i say it only shows his foolish impious pride and\\nabominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by a\\nportuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonahs going to nineveh\\nvia the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the\\ngeneral miracle and so it was besides to this day the highly\\nenlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah\\nand some three centuries ago an english traveller in old harriss\\nvoyages speaks of a turkish mosque built in honor of jonah in which\\nmosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil\\n\\n\\nchapter 84 pitchpoling\\n\\nto make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages are\\nanointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform an\\nanalogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom nor is it\\nto be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm it may possibly\\nbe of no contemptible advantage considering that oil and water are\\nhostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is to\\nmake the boat slide bravely queequeg believed strongly in anointing\\nhis boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau\\ndisappeared took more than customary pains in that occupation\\ncrawling under its bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing in\\nthe unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair\\nfrom the crafts bald keel he seemed to be working in obedience to\\nsome particular presentiment nor did it remain unwarranted by the\\nevent\\n\\ntowards noon whales were raised but so soon as the ship sailed down to\\nthem they turned and fled with swift precipitancy a disordered\\nflight as of cleopatras barges from actium\\n\\nnevertheless the boats pursued and stubbs was foremost by great\\nexertion tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the\\nstricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal\\nflight with added fleetness such unintermitted strainings upon the\\nplanted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it it became\\nimperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him but to\\nhaul the boat up to his flank was impossible he swam so fast and\\nfurious what then remained\\n\\nof all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand and\\ncountless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced\\nnone exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling small\\nsword or broad sword in all its exercises boasts nothing like it it\\nis only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand fact\\nand feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is\\naccurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme\\nheadway steel and wood included the entire spear is some ten or\\ntwelve feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the\\nharpoon and also of a lighter materialpine it is furnished with a\\nsmall rope called a warp of considerable length by which it can be\\nhauled back to the hand after darting\\n\\nbut before going further it is important to mention here that though\\nthe harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is\\nseldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on\\naccount of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as\\ncompared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks as a\\ngeneral thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before\\nany pitchpoling comes into play\\n\\nlook now at stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolness and\\nequanimity in the direst emergencies was specially qualified to excel\\nin pitchpoling look at him he stands upright in the tossed bow of the\\nflying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty feet\\nahead handling the long lance lightly glancing twice or thrice along\\nits length to see if it be exactly straight stubb whistlingly gathers\\nup the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secure its free end in\\nhis grasp leaving the rest unobstructed then holding the lance full\\nbefore his waistbands middle he levels it at the whale when\\ncovering him with it he steadily depresses the buttend in his hand\\nthereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon\\nhis palm fifteen feet in the air he minds you somewhat of a juggler\\nbalancing a long staff on his chin next moment with a rapid nameless\\nimpulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming\\ndistance and quivers in the life spot of the whale instead of\\nsparkling water he now spouts red blood\\n\\nthat drove the spigot out of him cried stubb tis julys immortal\\nfourth all fountains must run wine today would now it were old\\norleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakable old monongahela then\\ntashtego lad id have ye hold a canakin to the jet and wed drink\\nround it yea verily hearts alive wed brew choice punch in the\\nspread of his spouthole there and from that live punchbowl quaff the\\nliving stuff\\n\\nagain and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated\\nthe spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful\\nleash the agonized whale goes into his flurry the towline is\\nslackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern folds his hands and\\nmutely watches the monster die\\n\\n\\nchapter 85 the fountain\\n\\nthat for six thousand yearsand no one knows how many millions of ages\\nbeforethe great whales should have been spouting all over the sea and\\nsprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep as with so many\\nsprinkling or mistifying pots and that for some centuries back\\nthousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the\\nwhale watching these sprinklings and spoutingsthat all this should\\nbe and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter\\nminutes past one oclock pm of this sixteenth day of december ad\\n1851 it should still remain a problem whether these spoutings are\\nafter all really water or nothing but vaporthis is surely a\\nnoteworthy thing\\n\\nlet us then look at this matter along with some interesting items\\ncontingent every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\\ngills the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\\nis combined with the element in which they swim hence a herring or a\\ncod might live a century and never once raise its head above the\\nsurface but owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\\nregular lungs like a human beings the whale can only live by\\ninhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere wherefore the\\nnecessity for his periodical visits to the upper world but he cannot\\nin any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude\\nthe sperm whales mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the\\nsurface and what is still more his windpipe has no connexion with his\\nmouth no he breathes through his spiracle alone and this is on the\\ntop of his head\\n\\nif i say that in any creature breathing is only a function\\nindispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\\ncertain element which being subsequently brought into contact with the\\nblood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle i do not think i\\nshall err though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words\\nassume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be\\naerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostrils and not\\nfetch another for a considerable time that is to say he would then\\nlive without breathing anomalous as it may seem this is precisely the\\ncase with the whale who systematically lives by intervals his full\\nhour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or\\nso much as in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he has\\nno gills how is this between his ribs and on each side of his spine\\nhe is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of\\nvermicellilike vessels which vessels when he quits the surface are\\ncompletely distended with oxygenated blood so that for an hour or\\nmore a thousand fathoms in the sea he carries a surplus stock of\\nvitality in him just as the camel crossing the waterless desert\\ncarries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\\nsupplementary stomachs the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\\nindisputable and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable\\nand true seems the more cogent to me when i consider the otherwise\\ninexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_\\nas the fishermen phrase it this is what i mean if unmolested upon\\nrising to the surface the sperm whale will continue there for a period\\nof time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings say he\\nstays eleven minutes and jets seventy times that is respires seventy\\nbreaths then whenever he rises again he will be sure to have his\\nseventy breaths over again to a minute now if after he fetches a few\\nbreaths you alarm him so that he sounds he will be always dodging up\\nagain to make good his regular allowance of air and not till those\\nseventy breaths are told will he finally go down to stay out his full\\nterm below remark however that in different individuals these rates\\nare different but in any one they are alike now why should the whale\\nthus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it be to replenish\\nhis reservoir of air ere descending for good how obvious is it too\\nthat this necessity for the whales rising exposes him to all the fatal\\nhazards of the chase for not by hook or by net could this vast\\nleviathan be caught when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the\\nsunlight not so much thy skill then o hunter as the great\\nnecessities that strike the victory to thee\\n\\nin man breathing is incessantly going onone breath only serving for\\ntwo or three pulsations so that whatever other business he has to\\nattend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will but the\\nsperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time\\n\\nit has been said that the whale only breathes through his spouthole\\nif it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water\\nthen i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of\\nsmell seems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that at\\nall answers to his nose is that identical spouthole and being so\\nclogged with two elements it could not be expected to have the power\\nof smelling but owing to the mystery of the spoutwhether it be water\\nor whether it be vaporno absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at\\non this head sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale has no\\nproper olfactories but what does he want of them no roses no\\nviolets no colognewater in the sea\\n\\nfurthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting\\ncanal and as that long canallike the grand erie canalis furnished\\nwith a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of\\nair or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has no voice\\nunless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles he\\ntalks through his nose but then again what has the whale to say\\nseldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to this\\nworld unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\\nliving oh happy that the world is such an excellent listener\\n\\nnow the spouting canal of the sperm whale chiefly intended as it is\\nfor the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along\\nhorizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little\\nto one side this curious canal is very much like a gaspipe laid down\\nin a city on one side of a street but the question returns whether\\nthis gaspipe is also a waterpipe in other words whether the spout\\nof the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath or whether\\nthat exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and\\ndischarged through the spiracle it is certain that the mouth\\nindirectly communicates with the spouting canal but it cannot be\\nproved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the\\nspiracle because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be\\nwhen in feeding he accidentally takes in water but the sperm whales\\nfood is far beneath the surface and there he cannot spout even if he\\nwould besides if you regard him very closely and time him with your\\nwatch you will find that when unmolested there is an undeviating\\nrhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of\\nrespiration\\n\\nbut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject speak out\\nyou have seen him spout then declare what the spout is can you not\\ntell water from air my dear sir in this world it is not so easy to\\nsettle these plain things i have ever found your plain things the\\nknottiest of all and as for this whale spout you might almost stand\\nin it and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely\\n\\nthe central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\\nit and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it\\nwhen always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view\\nof his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading all\\naround him and if at such times you should think that you really\\nperceived drops of moisture in the spout how do you know that they are\\nnot merely condensed from its vapor or how do you know that they are\\nnot those identical drops superficially lodged in the spouthole\\nfissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whales head for\\neven when tranquilly swimming through the midday sea in a calm with\\nhis elevated hump sundried as a dromedarys in the desert even then\\nthe whale always carries a small basin of water on his head as under a\\nblazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\\nrain\\n\\nnor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\\nprecise nature of the whale spout it will not do for him to be peering\\ninto it and putting his face in it you cannot go with your pitcher to\\nthis fountain and fill it and bring it away for even when coming into\\nslight contact with the outer vapory shreds of the jet which will\\noften happen your skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of\\nthe thing so touching it and i know one who coming into still closer\\ncontact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view or\\notherwise i cannot say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm\\nwherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to\\nevade it another thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubt\\nit that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes it will blind\\nyou the wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me is\\nto let this deadly spout alone\\n\\nstill we can hypothesize even if we cannot prove and establish my\\nhypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist and besides\\nother reasons to this conclusion i am impelled by considerations\\ntouching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale i\\naccount him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputed\\nfact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other\\nwhales sometimes are he is both ponderous and profound and i am\\nconvinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings such as\\nplato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always goes\\nup a certain semivisible steam while in the act of thinking deep\\nthoughts while composing a little treatise on eternity i had the\\ncuriosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflected\\nthere a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over\\nmy head the invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep\\nthought after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an\\naugust noon this seems an additional argument for the above\\nsupposition\\n\\nand how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster to\\nbehold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild\\nhead overhung by a canopy of vapor engendered by his incommunicable\\ncontemplations and that vaporas you will sometimes see itglorified\\nby a rainbow as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts\\nfor dye see rainbows do not visit the clear air they only irradiate\\nvapor and so through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my\\nmind divine intuitions now and then shoot enkindling my fog with a\\nheavenly ray and for this i thank god for all have doubts many deny\\nbut doubts or denials few along with them have intuitions doubts of\\nall things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly this\\ncombination makes neither believer nor infidel but makes a man who\\nregards them both with equal eye\\n\\n\\nchapter 86 the tail\\n\\nother poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope\\nand the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less celestial\\ni celebrate a tail\\n\\nreckoning the largest sized sperm whales tail to begin at that point\\nof the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man it comprises\\nupon its upper surface alone an area of at least fifty square feet\\nthe compact round body of its root expands into two broad firm flat\\npalms or flukes gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in\\nthickness at the crotch or junction these flukes slightly overlap\\nthen sideways recede from each other like wings leaving a wide vacancy\\nbetween in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely\\ndefined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes at its utmost\\nexpansion in the full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed\\ntwenty feet across\\n\\nthe entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews but cut\\ninto it and you find that three distinct strata compose itupper\\nmiddle and lower the fibres in the upper and lower layers are long\\nand horizontal those of the middle one very short and running\\ncrosswise between the outside layers this triune structure as much as\\nanything else imparts power to the tail to the student of old roman\\nwalls the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin\\ncourse of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful\\nrelics of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the\\ngreat strength of the masonry\\n\\nbut as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough\\nthe whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of\\nmuscular fibres and filaments which passing on either side the loins\\nand running down into the flukes insensibly blend with them and\\nlargely contribute to their might so that in the tail the confluent\\nmeasureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point\\ncould annihilation occur to matter this were the thing to do it\\n\\nnor does thisits amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful\\nflexion of its motions where infantileness of ease undulates through a\\ntitanism of power on the contrary those motions derive their most\\nappalling beauty from it real strength never impairs beauty or\\nharmony but it often bestows it and in everything imposingly\\nbeautiful strength has much to do with the magic take away the tied\\ntendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved\\nhercules and its charm would be gone as devout eckerman lifted the\\nlinen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe he was overwhelmed with\\nthe massive chest of the man that seemed as a roman triumphal arch\\nwhen angelo paints even god the father in human form mark what\\nrobustness is there and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in\\nthe son the soft curled hermaphroditical italian pictures in which\\nhis idea has been most successfully embodied these pictures so\\ndestitute as they are of all brawniness hint nothing of any power but\\nthe mere negative feminine one of submission and endurance which on\\nall hands it is conceded form the peculiar practical virtues of his\\nteachings\\n\\nsuch is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of that whether\\nwielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the mood it\\nbe in its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace therein\\nno fairys arm can transcend it\\n\\nfive great motions are peculiar to it first when used as a fin for\\nprogression second when used as a mace in battle third in sweeping\\nfourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking flukes\\n\\nfirst being horizontal in its position the leviathans tail acts in a\\ndifferent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures it never\\nwriggles in man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority to the\\nwhale his tail is the sole means of propulsion scrollwise coiled\\nforwards beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it is\\nthis which gives that singular darting leaping motion to the monster\\nwhen furiously swimming his sidefins only serve to steer by\\n\\nsecond it is a little significant that while one sperm whale only\\nfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in his\\nconflicts with man he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail in\\nstriking at a boat he swiftly curves away his flukes from it and the\\nblow is only inflicted by the recoil if it be made in the unobstructed\\nair especially if it descend to its mark the stroke is then simply\\nirresistible no ribs of man or boat can withstand it your only\\nsalvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through the\\nopposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the\\nwhaleboat and the elasticity of its materials a cracked rib or a\\ndashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally the\\nmost serious result these submerged side blows are so often received\\nin the fishery that they are accounted mere childs play some one\\nstrips off a frock and the hole is stopped\\n\\nthird i cannot demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whale\\nthe sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respect\\nthere is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\\nelephants trunk this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\\nsweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\\nslowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\\nthe sea and if he feel but a sailors whisker woe to that sailor\\nwhiskers and all what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch\\nhad this tail any prehensile power i should straightway bethink me of\\ndarmonodes elephant that so frequented the flowermarket and with low\\nsalutations presented nosegays to damsels and then caressed their\\nzones on more accounts than one a pity it is that the whale does not\\npossess this prehensile virtue in his tail for i have heard of yet\\nanother elephant that when wounded in the fight curved round his\\ntrunk and extracted the dart\\n\\nfourth stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\\nmiddle of solitary seas you find him unbent from the vast corpulence\\nof his dignity and kittenlike he plays on the ocean as if it were a\\nhearth but still you see his power in his play the broad palms of his\\ntail are flirted high into the air then smiting the surface the\\nthunderous concussion resounds for miles you would almost think a\\ngreat gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of\\nvapor from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think that\\nthat was the smoke from the touchhole\\n\\nfifth as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes\\nlie considerably below the level of his back they are then completely\\nout of sight beneath the surface but when he is about to plunge into\\nthe deeps his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are\\ntossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating a moment till they\\ndownwards shoot out of view excepting the sublime _breach_somewhere\\nelse to be describedthis peaking of the whales flukes is perhaps the\\ngrandest sight to be seen in all animated nature out of the bottomless\\nprofundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\\nhighest heaven so in dreams have i seen majestic satan thrusting\\nforth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell but in\\ngazing at such scenes it is all in all what mood you are in if in the\\ndantean the devils will occur to you if in that of isaiah the\\narchangels standing at the masthead of my ship during a sunrise that\\ncrimsoned sky and sea i once saw a large herd of whales in the east\\nall heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with\\npeaked flukes as it seemed to me at the time such a grand embodiment\\nof adoration of the gods was never beheld even in persia the home of\\nthe fire worshippers as ptolemy philopater testified of the african\\nelephant i then testified of the whale pronouncing him the most\\ndevout of all beings for according to king juba the military\\nelephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks\\nuplifted in the profoundest silence\\n\\nthe chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the\\nelephant so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\\nof the other are concerned should not tend to place those two opposite\\norgans on an equality much less the creatures to which they\\nrespectively belong for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to\\nleviathan so compared with leviathans tail his trunk is but the\\nstalk of a lily the most direful blow from the elephants trunk were\\nas the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless crush and\\ncrash of the sperm whales ponderous flukes which in

correspond\\nto the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and\\nconsidering the inexhaustible wealth of spices and silks and jewels\\nand gold and ivory with which the thousand islands of that oriental\\nsea are enriched it seems a significant provision of nature that such\\ntreasures by the very formation of the land should at least bear the\\nappearance however ineffectual of being guarded from the allgrasping\\nwestern world the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied with\\nthose domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the\\nmediterranean the baltic and

by day have passed between the islands of sumatra\\nand java freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east but while\\nthey freely waive a ceremonial like this they do by no means renounce\\ntheir claim to more solid tribute\\n\\ntime out of mind the piratical proas of the malays lurking among the\\nlow shaded coves and islets of sumatra have sallied out upon the\\nvessels sailing through the straits fiercely demanding tribute at the\\npoint of their spears though by the repeated bloody chastisements they\\nhave received at the hands of european cruisers the audacity of these\\ncorsairs has of late been somewhat repressed yet even at the present\\nday we occasionally hear of english and american vessels which in\\nthose waters have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged\\n\\nwith a fair fresh wind the pequod was now drawing nigh to these\\nstraits ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea and\\nthence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here\\nand there by the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine islands\\nand gain the far coast of japan in time for the great whaling season\\nthere by these means the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost\\nall the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world previous to\\ndescending upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere\\nelse foiled in his pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to moby\\ndick in the sea he was most known to frequent and at a season when he\\nmight most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it\\n\\nbut how now in this zoned quest does ahab touch

the\\nark\\n\\nnow as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast of\\njava in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda indeed as most of\\nthe ground roundabout was generally recognised by the fishermen as an\\nexcellent spot for cruising therefore as the pequod gained more and\\nmore upon java head the lookouts were repeatedly hailed and\\nadmonished to keep wide awake but though the green palmy cliffs of the\\nland soon loomed on the starboard bow and with delighted nostrils the\\nfresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air yet not a single jet was\\ndescried almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game\\nhereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the straits when the\\ncustomary cheering cry was heard from aloft and ere long a spectacle\\nof singular magnificence saluted us\\n\\nbut here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activity with\\nwhich of late they have been hunted over all four oceans the sperm\\nwhales instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached\\ncompanies as in former times are now frequently met with in extensive\\nherds sometimes embracing so great a multitude that it would almost\\nseem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and\\ncovenant for mutual assistance and protection to this aggregation of\\nthe sperm whale into such immense caravans may be imputed the\\ncircumstance that even in the best cruising grounds you may now\\nsometimes sail for weeks and months together without being greeted by\\na single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems\\nthousands on thousands\\n\\nbroad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles and\\nforming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon a\\ncontinuous chain of whalejets were upplaying and sparkling in the\\nnoonday air unlike the straight perpendicular twinjets of the right\\nwhale which dividing at top fall over in two branches like the\\ncleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forwardslanting spout of\\nthe sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually\\nrising and falling away to leeward\\n\\nseen from the pequods deck then as she would rise on a high hill of\\nthe sea this host of vapory spouts individually curling up into the\\nair and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed\\nlike the thousand cheerful

all eagerness to place that perilous passage in\\ntheir rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the\\nplain even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward\\nthrough the straits gradually contracting the wings of their\\nsemicircle and swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre\\n\\ncrowding all sail the pequod pressed after them the harpooneers\\nhandling their weapons and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet\\nsuspended boats if the wind only held little doubt had they that\\nchased through these straits of sunda the vast host would only deploy\\ninto the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their\\nnumber and who could tell whether in that congregated caravan moby\\ndick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshipped\\nwhiteelephant in the coronation procession of the siamese so with\\nstunsail piled on stunsail we sailed along driving these leviathans\\nbefore us when of a sudden the voice of tashtego was heard loudly\\ndirecting attention to something in our wake\\n\\ncorresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in our\\nrear it seemed formed of detached white vapors rising and falling\\nsomething like the spouts of the whales only they did not so\\ncompletely come and go for they constantly hovered without finally\\ndisappearing levelling his glass at this sight ahab quickly revolved\\nin his pivothole crying aloft there and rig whips and buckets to\\nwet the sailsmalays sir and after us\\n\\nas if too long lurking behind the headlands till the pequod should\\nfairly have entered the straits these rascally asiatics were now in\\nhot pursuit to make up for their overcautious delay but when the\\nswift pequod with a fresh leading wind was herself in hot chase how\\nvery kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on\\nto her own chosen pursuitmere ridingwhips and rowels to her that\\nthey were as with glass under arm ahab toandfro paced the deck in\\nhis forward turn beholding the monsters he chased and in the after one\\nthe bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_ some such fancy as the above\\nseemed his and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery\\ndefile in which the ship was then sailing and bethought him that\\nthrough that gate lay the route to his vengeance and beheld how that\\nthrough that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his\\ndeadly end and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirates\\nand inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with\\ntheir curseswhen all these conceits had passed through his brain\\nahabs brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after\\nsome stormy tide has been gnawing it without being able to drag the\\nfirm thing from its place\\n\\nbut thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and\\nwhen after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern the\\npequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra\\nside emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond then the\\nharpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been\\ngaining upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship had so\\nvictoriously gained upon the malays but still driving on in the wake\\nof the whales at length they seemed abating their speed gradually the\\nship neared them and the wind now dying away word was passed to\\nspring to the boats but no sooner did the herd by some presumed\\nwonderful instinct of the sperm whale become notified of the three\\nkeels that were after themthough as yet a mile in their rearthan\\nthey rallied again and forming in close ranks and battalions so that\\ntheir spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets moved\\non with redoubled velocity\\n\\nstripped to our shirts and drawers we sprang to the whiteash and\\nafter several hours pulling were almost disposed to renounce the\\nchase when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating\\ntoken that they were now at last under the influence of that strange\\nperplexity of inert irresolution which when the fishermen perceive it\\nin the whale they say he is gallied the compact martial columns in\\nwhich they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now\\nbroken up in one measureless rout and like king porus elephants in\\nthe indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad with\\nconsternation in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles\\nand aimlessly swimming hither and thither by their short thick\\nspoutings they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic this was\\nstill more strangely evinced by those of their number who completely\\nparalysed as it were helplessly floated like waterlogged dismantled\\nships on the sea had these leviathans been but a flock of simple\\nsheep pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves they could not\\npossibly have evinced such excessive dismay but this occasional\\ntimidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures though\\nbanding together in tens of thousands the lionmaned buffaloes of the\\nwest have fled before a solitary horseman witness too all human\\nbeings how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatres pit\\nthey will at the slightest alarm of fire rush helterskelter for the\\noutlets crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each\\nother to death best therefore withhold any amazement at the\\nstrangely gallied whales before us for there is no folly of the beasts\\nof the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men\\n\\nthough many of the whales as has been said were in violent motion\\nyet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\\nretreated but collectively remained in one place as is customary in\\nthose cases the boats at once separated each making for some one lone\\nwhale on the outskirts of the shoal in about three minutes time\\nqueequegs harpoon was flung the stricken fish darted blinding spray\\nin our faces and then running away with us like light steered\\nstraight for the heart of the herd though such a movement on the part\\nof the whale struck under such circumstances is in no wise\\nunprecedented and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated\\nyet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the\\nfishery for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the\\nfrantic shoal you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a\\ndelirious throb\\n\\nas blind and deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer power of\\nspeed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him as we\\nthus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides menaced as we flew by\\nthe crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us our beset boat was\\nlike a ship mobbed by iceisles in a tempest and striving to steer\\nthrough their complicated channels and straits knowing not at what\\nmoment it may be locked in and crushed\\n\\nbut not a bit daunted queequeg steered us manfully now sheering off\\nfrom this monster directly across our route in advance now edging away\\nfrom that whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead while all the\\ntime starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand pricking out of our\\nway whatever whales he could reach by short darts for there was no\\ntime to make long ones nor were the oarsmen quite idle though their\\nwonted duty was now altogether dispensed with they chiefly attended to\\nthe shouting part of the business out of the way commodore cried\\none to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface\\nand for an instant threatened to swamp us hard down with your tail\\nthere cried a second to another which close to our gunwale seemed\\ncalmly cooling himself with his own fanlike extremity\\n\\nall whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances originally invented\\nby the nantucket indians called druggs two thick squares of wood of\\nequal size are stoutly clenched together so that they cross each\\nothers grain at right angles a line of considerable length is then\\nattached to the middle of this block and the other end of the line\\nbeing looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon it is\\nchiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used for then more\\nwhales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time but\\nsperm whales are not every day encountered while you may then you\\nmust kill all you can and if you cannot kill them all at once you\\nmust wing them so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure\\nhence it is that at times like these the drugg comes into\\nrequisition our boat was furnished with three of them the first and\\nsecond were successfully darted and we saw the whales staggeringly\\nrunning off fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing\\ndrugg they were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball but\\nupon flinging the third in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy\\nwooden block it caught under one of the seats of the boat and in an\\ninstant tore it out and carried it away dropping the oarsman in the\\nboats bottom as the seat slid from under him on both sides the sea\\ncame in at the wounded planks but we stuffed two or three drawers and\\nshirts in and so stopped the leaks for the time\\n\\nit had been next to impossible to dart these druggedharpoons were it\\nnot that as we advanced into the herd our whales way greatly\\ndiminished moreover that as we went still further and further from\\nthe circumference of commotion the direful disorders seemed waning so\\nthat when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towing whale\\nsideways vanished then with the tapering force of his parting\\nmomentum we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the\\nshoal as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\\nvalley lake here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost\\nwhales were heard but not felt in this central expanse the sea\\npresented that smooth satinlike surface called a sleek produced by\\nthe subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods\\nyes we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the\\nheart of every commotion and still in the distracted distance we\\nbeheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles and saw successive\\npods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly going round and round\\nlike multiplied spans of horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to\\nshoulder that a titanic circusrider might easily have overarched the\\nmiddle ones and so have gone round on their backs owing to the\\ndensity of the crowd of reposing whales more immediately surrounding\\nthe embayed axis of the herd no possible chance of escape was at\\npresent afforded us we must watch for a breach in the living wall that\\nhemmed us in the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us\\nup keeping at the centre of the lake we were occasionally visited by\\nsmall tame cows and calves the women and children of this routed host\\n\\nnow inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\\nouter circles and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in\\nany one of those circles the entire area at this juncture embraced by\\nthe whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square\\nmiles at any ratethough indeed such a test at such a time might be\\ndeceptivespoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed\\nplaying up almost from the rim of the horizon i mention this\\ncircumstance because as if the cows and calves had been purposely\\nlocked up in this innermost fold and as if the wide extent of the herd\\nhad hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its\\nstopping or possibly being so young unsophisticated and every way\\ninnocent and inexperienced however it may have been these smaller\\nwhalesnow and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the\\nlakeevinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence or else a still\\nbecharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at like\\nhousehold dogs they came snuffling round us right up to our gunwales\\nand touching them till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\\ndomesticated them queequeg patted their foreheads starbuck scratched\\ntheir backs with his lance but fearful of the consequences for the\\ntime refrained from darting it\\n\\nbut far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still\\nstranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side for suspended\\nin those watery vaults floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\\nwhales and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become\\nmothers the lake as i have hinted was to a considerable depth\\nexceedingly transparent and as human infants while suckling will\\ncalmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast as if leading two\\ndifferent lives at the time and while yet drawing mortal nourishment\\nbe still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscenceeven so\\ndid the young of these whales seem looking up towards us but not at\\nus as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their newborn sight\\nfloating on their sides the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us one\\nof these little infants that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a\\nday old might have measured some fourteen feet in length and some six\\nfeet in girth he was a little frisky though as yet his body seemed\\nscarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately\\noccupied in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready\\nfor the final spring the unborn whale lies bent like a

entranced the occasional sudden frantic\\nspectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats\\nstill engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host or\\npossibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundance\\nof room and some convenient retreats were afforded them but the sight\\nof the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro\\nacross the circles was nothing to what at last met our eyes it is\\nsometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful\\nand alert to seek to hamstring him as it were by sundering or\\nmaiming his gigantic tailtendon it is done by darting a shorthandled\\ncuttingspade to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again a\\nwhale wounded as we afterwards learned in this part but not\\neffectually as it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying\\nalong with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony\\nof the wound he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the\\nlone mounted desperado arnold at the battle of saratoga carrying\\ndismay wherever he went\\n\\nbut agonizing as was the wound of this whale and an appalling\\nspectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed\\nto inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which at first\\nthe intervening distance obscured from us but at length we perceived\\nthat by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery this whale\\nhad become entangled in the harpoonline that he towed he had also run\\naway with the cuttingspade in him and while the free end of the rope\\nattached to that weapon had permanently caught in the coils of the\\nharpoonline round his tail the cuttingspade itself had worked loose\\nfrom his flesh so that tormented to madness he was now churning\\nthrough the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and\\ntossing the keen spade about him wounding and murdering his own\\ncomrades\\n\\nthis terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\\nstationary fright first the whales forming the margin of our lake\\nbegan to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if lifted by\\nhalf spent billows from afar then the lake itself began faintly to\\nheave and swell the submarine bridalchambers and nurseries vanished\\nin more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central\\ncircles began to swim in thickening clusters yes the long calm was\\ndeparting a low advancing hum was soon heard and then like to the\\ntumultuous masses of blockice when the great river hudson breaks up in\\nspring the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner\\ncentre as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain instantly\\nstarbuck and queequeg changed places

between their long lengths but by desperate\\nendeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way\\nrapidly and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet\\nafter many similar hairbreadth escapes we at last swiftly glided into\\nwhat had just been one of the outer circles but now crossed by random\\nwhales all violently making for one centre this lucky salvation was\\ncheaply purchased by the loss of queequegs hat who while standing in\\nthe bows to prick the fugitive whales had his hat taken clean from his\\nhead by the aireddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad\\nflukes close by\\n\\nriotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was it soon\\nresolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for having\\nclumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their\\nonward flight with augmented fleetness further pursuit was useless\\nbut the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged\\nwhales might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which flask\\nhad killed and waifed the waif is a pennoned pole two or three of\\nwhich are carried by every boat and which when additional game is at\\nhand are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both\\nto mark its place on the sea and also as token of prior possession\\nshould the boats of any other ship draw near\\n\\nthe result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious\\nsaying in the fisherythe more whales the less fish of all the\\ndrugged whales only one was captured the rest contrived to escape for\\nthe time but only to be taken as will hereafter be seen by some\\nother craft than the pequod\\n\\n\\nchapter 88 schools and schoolmasters\\n\\nthe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm\\nwhales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those\\nvast aggregations\\n\\nnow though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as must\\nhave been seen even at the present day small detached bands are\\noccasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each\\nsuch bands are known as schools they generally are of two sorts those\\ncomposed almost entirely of females and those mustering none but young\\nvigorous males or bulls as they are familiarly designated\\n\\nin cavalier attendance upon the school of females you invariably see a\\nmale of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evinces\\nhis gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his\\nladies in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about\\nover the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and\\nendearments of the harem the contrast between this ottoman and his\\nconcubines is striking because while he is always of the largest\\nleviathanic proportions the ladies even at full growth are not more\\nthan onethird of the bulk of an averagesized male they are\\ncomparatively delicate indeed i dare say not to exceed half a dozen\\nyards round the waist nevertheless it cannot be denied that upon the\\nwhole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_\\n\\nit is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\\nramblings like fashionables they are for ever on the move in\\nleisurely search of variety you meet them on the line in time for the\\nfull flower of the equatorial feeding season having just returned\\nperhaps from spending the summer in the northern seas and so cheating\\nsummer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth by the time they have\\nlounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile they start for\\nthe oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there and so\\nevade the other excessive temperature of the year\\n\\nwhen serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange\\nsuspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\\ninteresting family should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan\\ncoming that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the\\nladies with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him and chases\\nhim away high times indeed if unprincipled young rakes like him are\\nto be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do\\nwhat the bashaw will he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out of\\nhis bed for alas all fish bed in common as ashore the ladies often\\ncause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers just so with\\nthe whales who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love they\\nfence with their long lower jaws sometimes locking them together and\\nso striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their\\nantlers not a few are captured having the deep scars of these\\nencountersfurrowed heads broken teeth scolloped fins and in some\\ninstances wrenched and dislocated mouths\\n\\nbut supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at\\nthe first rush of the harems lord then is it very diverting to watch\\nthat lord gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and\\nrevels there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario\\nlike pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines\\ngranting other whales to be in sight the fishermen will seldom give\\nchase to one of these grand turks for these grand turks are too lavish\\nof their strength and hence their unctuousness is small as for the\\nsons and the daughters they beget why those sons and daughters must\\ntake care of themselves at least with only the maternal help for\\nlike certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named my\\nlord whale has no taste for the nursery however much for the bower\\nand so being a great traveller he leaves his anonymous babies all\\nover the world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless as\\nthe ardour of youth declines as years and dumps increase as\\nreflection lends her solemn pauses in short as a general lassitude\\novertakes the sated turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the\\nlove for maidens our ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant\\nadmonitory stage of life forswears disbands the

the\\nname bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmised that the\\nman who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have read\\nthe memoirs of vidocq and informed himself what sort of a\\ncountryschoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger days and\\nwhat was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of\\nhis pupils\\n\\nthe same secludedness and

fastfish and loosefish\\n\\nthe allusion to the waif and waifpoles in the last chapter but one\\nnecessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale\\nfishery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge\\n\\nit frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company\\na whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be finally killed\\nand captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprised\\nmany minor contingencies all partaking of this one grand feature for\\nexampleafter a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the\\nbody may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and\\ndrifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a\\ncalm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line thus the\\nmost vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the\\nfishermen were there not some written or unwritten universal\\nundisputed law applicable to all cases\\n\\nperhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative\\nenactment was that of holland it was decreed by the statesgeneral in\\nad 1695 but though no other nation has ever had any written whaling\\nlaw yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators and\\nlawyers in this matter they have provided a system which for terse\\ncomprehensiveness surpasses justinians pandects and the bylaws of the\\nchinese society for the suppression of meddling with other peoples\\nbusiness yes these laws might be engraven on a queen annes farthing\\nor the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck so small are they\\n\\ni a fastfish belongs to the party fast to it\\n\\nii a loosefish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it\\n\\nbut what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable\\nbrevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to\\nexpound it\\n\\nfirst what is a fastfish alive or dead a fish is technically fast\\nwhen it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any medium at\\nall controllable by the occupant or occupantsa mast an oar a\\nnineinch cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is all the\\nsame likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif or any\\nother recognised symbol of possession so long as the party waifing it\\nplainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside as well\\nas their intention so to do\\n\\nthese are scientific commentaries but the commentaries of the whalemen\\nthemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocksthe\\ncokeuponlittleton of the fist true among the more upright and\\nhonorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases where\\nit would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim\\npossession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party but\\nothers are by no means so scrupulous\\n\\nsome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whaletrover litigated\\nin england wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of\\na whale in the northern seas and when indeed they the plaintiffs had\\nsucceeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril of\\ntheir lives obliged to forsake not only their lines but their boat\\nitself ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came up\\nwith the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated it\\nbefore the very eyes of the plaintiffs and when those defendants were\\nremonstrated with their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs\\nteeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had\\ndone he would now retain their line harpoons and boat which had\\nremained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure wherefore\\nthe plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale\\nline harpoons and boat\\n\\nmr erskine was counsel for the defendants lord ellenborough was the\\njudge in the course of the defence the witty erskine went on to\\nillustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con case\\nwherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wifes\\nviciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but in\\nthe course of years repenting of that step he instituted an action to\\nrecover possession of her erskine was on the other side and he then\\nsupported it by saying that though the gentleman had originally\\nharpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason of\\nthe great stress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandoned\\nher yet abandon her he did so that she became a loosefish and\\ntherefore when a subsequent gentleman reharpooned her the lady then\\nbecame that subsequent gentlemans property along with whatever\\nharpoon might have been found sticking in her\\n\\nnow in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the\\nwhale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other\\n\\nthese pleadings and the counter pleadings being duly heard the very\\nlearned judge in set terms decided to witthat as for the boat he\\nawarded it to the plaintiffs because they had merely abandoned it to\\nsave their lives but that with regard to the controverted whale\\nharpoons and line they belonged to the defendants the whale because\\nit was a loosefish at the time of the final capture and the harpoons\\nand line because when the fish made off with them it the fish\\nacquired a property in those articles and hence anybody who afterwards\\ntook the fish had a right to them now the defendants afterwards took\\nthe fish ergo the aforesaid articles were theirs\\n\\na common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might\\npossibly object to it but ploughed up to the primary rock of the\\nmatter the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws\\npreviously quoted and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in\\nthe above cited case these two laws touching fastfish and loosefish\\ni say will on reflection be found the fundamentals of all human\\njurisprudence for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of\\nsculpture the temple of the law like the temple of the philistines\\nhas but two props to stand on\\n\\nis it not a saying in every ones mouth possession is half of the law\\nthat is regardless of how the thing came into possession but often\\npossession is the whole of the law what are the sinews and souls of\\nrussian serfs and republican slaves but fastfish whereof possession\\nis the whole of the law what to the rapacious landlord is the widows\\nlast mite but a fastfish what is yonder undetected villains marble\\nmansion with a doorplate for a waif what is that but a fastfish\\nwhat is the ruinous discount which mordecai the broker gets from poor\\nwoebegone the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegones family from\\nstarvation what is that ruinous discount but a fastfish what is the\\narchbishop of savesouls income of 100000 seized from the scant bread\\nand cheese of hundreds of thousands of brokenbacked laborers all sure\\nof heaven without any of savesouls help what is that globular\\n100000 but a fastfish what are the duke of dunders hereditary\\ntowns and hamlets but fastfish what to that redoubted harpooneer\\njohn bull is poor ireland but a fastfish what to that apostolic\\nlancer brother jonathan is texas but a fastfish and concerning all\\nthese is not possession the whole of the law\\n\\nbut if the doctrine of fastfish be pretty generally applicable the\\nkindred doctrine of loosefish is still more widely so that is\\ninternationally and universally applicable\\n\\nwhat was america in 1492 but a loosefish in which columbus struck the\\nspanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and\\nmistress what was poland to the czar what greece to the turk what\\nindia to england what at last will mexico be to the united states all\\nloosefish\\n\\nwhat are the rights of man and the liberties of the world but\\nloosefish what all mens minds and opinions

3_\\n\\nlatin from the books of the laws of england which taken along with the\\ncontext means that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of\\nthat land the king as honorary grand harpooneer must have the head\\nand the queen be respectfully presented with the tail a division\\nwhich in the whale is much like halving an apple there is no\\nintermediate remainder now as this law under a modified form is to\\nthis day in force in england and as it offers in various respects a\\nstrange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loosefish it is\\nhere treated of in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle\\nthat prompts the english railways to be at the expense of a separate\\ncar specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty in the first\\nplace in curious proof of the fact that the abovementioned law is\\nstill in force i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that\\nhappened within the last two years\\n\\nit seems that some honest mariners of dover or sandwich or some one\\nof the cinque ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and\\nbeaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from\\nthe shore now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under the\\njurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle called a lord warden\\nholding the office directly from the crown i believe all the royal\\nemoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignment\\nhis by some writers this office is called a sinecure but not so\\nbecause the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his\\nperquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of\\nthem\\n\\nnow when these poor sunburnt mariners barefooted and with their\\ntrowsers rolled high up on their eely legs had wearily hauled their\\nfat fish high and dry promising themselves a good 150 from the\\nprecious oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their\\nwives and good ale with their cronies upon the strength of their\\nrespective shares up steps a very learned and most christian and\\ncharitable gentleman with a copy of blackstone under his arm and\\nlaying it upon the whales head he sayshands off this fish my\\nmasters is a fastfish i seize it as the lord wardens upon this\\nthe poor mariners in their respectful consternationso truly\\nenglishknowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching their\\nheads all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the\\nstranger but that did in nowise mend the matter or at all soften the\\nhard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone at\\nlength one of them after long scratching about for his ideas made\\nbold to speak\\n\\nplease sir who is the lord warden\\n\\nthe duke\\n\\nbut the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish\\n\\nit is his\\n\\nwe have been at great trouble and peril and some expense and is all\\nthat to go to the dukes benefit we getting nothing at all for our\\npains but our blisters\\n\\nit is his\\n\\nis the duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of\\ngetting a livelihood\\n\\nit is his\\n\\ni thought to relieve my old bedridden mother by part of my share of\\nthis whale\\n\\nit is his\\n\\nwont the duke be content with a quarter or a half\\n\\nit is his\\n\\nin a word the whale was seized and sold and his grace the duke of\\nwellington received the money thinking that viewed in some particular\\nlights the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be\\ndeemed under the circumstances a rather hard one an honest clergyman\\nof the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace begging him to\\ntake the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration to\\nwhich my lord duke in substance replied both letters were published\\nthat he had already done so and received the money and would be\\nobliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverend\\ngentleman would decline meddling with other peoples business is this\\nthe still militant old man standing at the corners of the three\\nkingdoms on all hands coercing alms of beggars\\n\\nit will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duke\\nto the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign we must needs\\ninquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested\\nwith that right the law itself has already been set forth but plowdon\\ngives us the reason for it says plowdon the whale so caught belongs\\nto the king and queen because of its superior excellence and by the\\nsoundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such\\nmatters\\n\\nbut why should the king have the head and the queen the tail a reason\\nfor that ye lawyers\\n\\nin his treatise on queengold or queenpinmoney an old kings bench\\nauthor one william prynne thus discourseth ye tail is ye queens\\nthat ye queens wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone now this\\nwas written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or\\nright whale was largely used in ladies bodices but this same bone is\\nnot in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for a\\nsagacious lawyer like prynne but is the queen a mermaid to be\\npresented with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk here\\n\\nthere are two royal fish so styled by the english law writersthe whale\\nand the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitations and\\nnominally supplying the tenth branch of the crowns ordinary revenue i\\nknow not that any other author has hinted of the matter but by\\ninference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same\\nway as the whale the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head\\npeculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be\\nhumorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality and thus there\\nseems a reason in all things even in law\\n\\n\\nchapter 91 the pequod meets the rosebud\\n\\nin vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this\\nleviathan insufferable fetor denying not inquiry _sir t browne\\nve_\\n\\nit was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when\\nwe were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapory midday sea that the\\nmany noses on the pequods deck proved more vigilant discoverers than\\nthe three pairs of eyes aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell\\nwas smelt in the sea\\n\\ni will bet something now said stubb that somewhere hereabouts are\\nsome of those drugged whales we tickled the other day i thought they\\nwould keel up before long\\n\\npresently the vapors in advance slid aside and there in the distance\\nlay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must\\nbe alongside as we glided nearer the stranger showed french colours\\nfrom his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture seafowl that\\ncircled and hovered and swooped around him it was plain that the\\nwhale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale that\\nis a whale that has died unmolested on the sea and so floated an\\nunappropriated corpse it may well be conceived what an unsavory odor\\nsuch a mass must exhale worse than an assyrian city in the plague\\nwhen the living are incompetent to bury the departed so intolerable\\nindeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them to\\nmoor alongside of it yet are there those who will still do it\\nnotwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of\\na very inferior quality and by no means of the nature of\\nattarofrose\\n\\ncoming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the frenchman\\nhad a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more of\\na nosegay than the first in truth it turned out to be one of those\\nproblematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of\\nprodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodies\\nalmost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in the\\nproper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up\\nhis nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun blasted\\nwhales in general\\n\\nthe pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vowed he\\nrecognised his cutting spadepole entangled in the lines that were\\nknotted round the tail of one of these whales\\n\\ntheres a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in the\\nships bows theres a jackal for ye i well know that these crappoes\\nof frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery sometimes lowering\\ntheir boats for breakers mistaking them for sperm whale spouts yes\\nand sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of\\ntallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeing that all the oil they\\nwill get wont be enough to dip the captains wick into aye we all\\nknow these things but look ye heres a crappo that is content with\\nour leavings the drugged whale there i mean aye and is content too\\nwith scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there\\npoor devil i say pass round a hat some one and lets make him a\\npresent of a little oil for dear charitys sake for what oil hell get\\nfrom that drugged whale there wouldnt be fit to burn in a jail no\\nnot in a condemned cell and as for the other whale why ill agree to\\nget more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours\\nthan hell get from that bundle of bones though now that i think of\\nit it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes\\nambergris i wonder now if our old man has thought of that its worth\\ntrying yes im for it and so saying he started for the\\nquarterdeck\\n\\nby this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether\\nor no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope\\nof escaping except by its breezing up again issuing from the cabin\\nstubb now called his boats crew and pulled off for the stranger\\ndrawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the\\nfanciful french taste the upper part of her stempiece was carved in\\nthe likeness of a huge drooping stalk was painted green and for\\nthorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there the whole\\nterminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour upon\\nher head boards in large gilt letters he read bouton de\\nroserosebutton or rosebud and this was the romantic name of this\\naromatic ship\\n\\nthough stubb did not understand the _bouton_ part of the inscription\\nyet the word _rose_ and the bulbous figurehead put together\\nsufficiently explained the whole to him\\n\\na wooden rosebud eh he cried with his hand to his nose that will\\ndo very well but how like all creation it smells\\n\\nnow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck he\\nhad to pull round the bows to the starboard side and thus come close\\nto the blasted whale and so talk over it\\n\\narrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he\\nbawledboutonderose ahoy are there any of you boutonderoses that\\nspeak english\\n\\nyes rejoined a guernseyman from the bulwarks who turned out to be\\nthe chiefmate\\n\\nwell then my boutonderosebud have you seen the white whale\\n\\n_what_ whale\\n\\nthe _white_ whalea sperm whalemoby dick have ye seen him\\n\\nnever heard of such a whale cachalot blanche white whaleno\\n\\nvery good then good bye now and ill call again in a minute\\n\\nthen rapidly pulling back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaning\\nover the quarterdeck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two\\nhands into a trumpet and shoutedno sir no upon which ahab\\nretired and stubb returned to the frenchman\\n\\nhe now perceived that the guernseyman who had just got into the\\nchains and was using a cuttingspade had slung his nose in a sort of\\nbag\\n\\nwhats the matter with your nose there said stubb broke it\\n\\ni wish it was broken or that i didnt have any nose at all answered\\nthe guernseyman who did not seem to relish the job he was at very\\nmuch but what are you holding _yours_ for\\n\\noh nothing its a wax nose i have to hold it on fine day aint\\nit air rather gardenny i should say throw us a bunch of posies will\\nye boutonderose\\n\\nwhat in the devils name do you want here roared the guernseyman\\nflying into a sudden passion\\n\\noh keep coolcool yes thats the word why dont you pack those\\nwhales in ice while youre working at em but joking aside though do\\nyou know rosebud that its all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\\nsuch whales as for that dried up one there he hasnt a gill in his\\nwhole carcase\\n\\ni know that well enough but dye see the captain here wont believe\\nit this is his first voyage he was a cologne manufacturer before but\\ncome aboard and mayhap hell believe you if he wont me and so ill\\nget out of this dirty scrape\\n\\nanything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined stubb\\nand with that he soon mounted to the deck there a queer scene\\npresented itself the sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted were\\ngetting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales but they worked\\nrather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good\\nhumor all their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many\\njibbooms now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up\\nto the masthead to get some fresh air some thinking they would catch\\nthe plague dipped oakum in coaltar and at intervals held it to their\\nnostrils others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\\noff at the bowl were vigorously puffing tobaccosmoke so that it\\nconstantly filled their olfactories\\n\\nstubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from\\nthe captains roundhouse abaft and looking in that direction saw a\\nfiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar from\\nwithin this was the tormented surgeon who after in vain\\nremonstrating against the proceedings of the day had betaken himself\\nto the captains roundhouse _cabinet_ he called it to avoid the\\npest but still could not help yelling out his entreaties and\\nindignations at times\\n\\nmarking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the\\nguernseyman had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate\\nexpressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus who\\nhad brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle\\nsounding him carefully stubb further perceived that the guernseyman\\nhad not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he therefore\\nheld his peace on that head but otherwise was quite frank and\\nconfidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\\nfor both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at all\\ndreaming of distrusting their sincerity according to this little plan\\nof theirs the guernseyman under cover of an interpreters office\\nwas to tell the captain what he pleased but as coming from stubb and\\nas for stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost\\nin him during the interview\\n\\nby this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin he was a\\nsmall and dark but rather delicate looking man for a seacaptain with\\nlarge whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet\\nvest with watchseals at his side to this gentleman stubb was now\\npolitely introduced by the guernseyman who at once ostentatiously put\\non the aspect of interpreting between them\\n\\nwhat shall i say to him first said he\\n\\nwhy said stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals you\\nmay as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me\\nthough i dont pretend to be a judge\\n\\nhe says monsieur said the guernseyman in french turning to his\\ncaptain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captain\\nand chiefmate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from a\\nblasted whale they had brought alongside\\n\\nupon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know more\\n\\nwhat now said the guernseyman to stubb\\n\\nwhy since he takes it so easy tell him that now i have eyed him\\ncarefully im quite certain that hes no more fit to command a\\nwhaleship than a st jago monkey in fact tell him from me hes a\\nbaboon\\n\\nhe vows and declares monsieur that the other whale the dried one\\nis far more deadly than the blasted one in fine monsieur he conjures\\nus as we value our lives to cut loose from these fish\\n\\ninstantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded his\\ncrew to desist from hoisting the cuttingtackles and at once cast\\nloose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship\\n\\nwhat now said the guernseyman when the captain had returned to\\nthem\\n\\nwhy let me see yes you may as well tell him now thatthatin fact\\ntell him ive diddled him and aside to himself perhaps somebody\\nelse\\n\\nhe says monsieur that hes very happy to have been of any service to\\nus\\n\\nhearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\\nmeaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down into\\nhis cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux\\n\\nhe wants you to take a glass of wine with him said the interpreter\\n\\nthank him heartily but tell him its against my principles to drink\\nwith the man ive diddled in fact tell him i must go\\n\\nhe says monsieur that his principles wont admit of his drinking\\nbut that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink then monsieur\\nhad best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales\\nfor its so calm they wont drift\\n\\nby this time stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailed\\nthe guernseyman to this effectthat having a long towline in his\\nboat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the\\nlighter whale of the two from the ships side while the frenchmans\\nboats then were engaged in towing the ship one way stubb\\nbenevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously\\nslacking out a most unusually long towline\\n\\npresently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned to cast off from the whale\\nhoisting his boats the frenchman soon increased his distance while\\nthe pequod slid in between him and stubbs whale whereupon stubb\\nquickly pulled to the floating body and hailing the pequod to give\\nnotice of his intentions at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his\\nunrighteous cunning seizing his sharp boatspade he commenced an\\nexcavation in the body a little behind the side fin you would almost\\nhave thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea and when at\\nlength his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was like turning up\\nold roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam his boats crew\\nwere all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking\\nas anxious as goldhunters\\n\\nand all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking and\\nscreaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb was beginning\\nto look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increased\\nwhen suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a\\nfaint stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smells\\nwithout being absorbed by it as one river will flow into and then\\nalong with another without at all blending with it for a time\\n\\ni have it i have it cried stubb with delight striking something\\nin the subterranean regions a purse a purse\\n\\ndropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls of\\nsomething that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old\\ncheese very unctuous and savory withal you might easily dent it with\\nyour thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour and this\\ngood friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\\ndruggist some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidably\\nlost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were\\nit not for impatient ahabs loud command to stubb to desist and come\\non board else the ship would bid them good bye\\n\\n\\nchapter 92 ambergris\\n\\nnow this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as an\\narticle of commerce that in 1791 a certain nantucketborn captain\\ncoffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that\\nsubject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day\\nthe precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem\\nto the learned though the word ambergris is but the french compound\\nfor grey amber yet the two substances are quite distinct for amber\\nthough at times found on the seacoast is also dug up in some far\\ninland soils whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea\\nbesides amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance\\nused for mouthpieces to pipes for beads and ornaments but ambergris\\nis soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely\\nused in perfumery in pastiles precious candles hairpowders and\\npomatum the turks use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for\\nthe same purpose that frankincense is carried to st peters in rome\\nsome wine merchants drop a few grains into claret to flavor it\\n\\nwho would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\\nregale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\\nsick whale yet so it is by some ambergris is supposed to be the\\ncause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to\\ncure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administering\\nthree or four boat loads of brandreths pills and then running out of\\nharms way as laborers do in blasting rocks\\n\\ni have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris\\ncertain hard round bony plates which at first stubb thought might be\\nsailors trowsers buttons but it afterwards turned out that they were\\nnothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner\\n\\nnow that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\\nfound in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of that\\nsaying of st paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruption\\nhow that we are sown in dishonor but raised in glory and likewise\\ncall to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the\\nbest musk also forget not the strange fact that of all things of\\nillsavor colognewater in its rudimental manufacturing stages is\\nthe worst\\n\\ni should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but\\ncannot owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\\nwhalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased minds\\nmight be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\\nof the frenchmans two whales elsewhere in this volume the slanderous\\naspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling is\\nthroughout a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing to\\nrebut they hint that all whales always smell bad now how did this\\nodious stigma originate\\n\\ni opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\\ngreenland whaling ships in london more than two centuries ago because\\nthose whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea\\nas the southern ships have always done but cutting up the fresh\\nblubber in small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large casks\\nand carry it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those\\nicy seas and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed\\nforbidding any other course the consequence is that upon breaking\\ninto the hold and unloading one of these whale cemeteries in the\\ngreenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising\\nfrom excavating an old city graveyard for the foundations of a\\nlyingin hospital\\n\\ni partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be\\nlikewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former\\ntimes of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which\\nlatter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack in his great\\nwork on smells a textbook on that subject as its name imports\\nsmeer fat berg to put up this village was founded in order to\\nafford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried\\nout without being taken home to holland for that purpose it was a\\ncollection of furnaces fatkettles and oil sheds and when the works\\nwere in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor but\\nall this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler which in a\\nvoyage of four years perhaps after completely filling her hold with\\noil does not perhaps consume fifty days in the business of boiling\\nout and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless\\nthe truth is that living or dead if but decently treated whales as a\\nspecies are by no means creatures of ill odor nor can whalemen be\\nrecognised as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a jew\\nin the company by the nose nor indeed can the whale possibly be\\notherwise than fragrant when as a general thing he enjoys such high\\nhealth taking abundance of exercise always out of doors though it\\nis true seldom in the open air i say that the motion of a sperm\\nwhales flukes above water dispenses a perfume as when a muskscented\\nlady rustles her dress in a warm parlor what then shall i liken the\\nsperm whale to for fragrance considering his magnitude must it not be\\nto that famous elephant with jewelled tusks and redolent with myrrh\\nwhich was led out of an indian town to do honor to alexander the great\\n\\n\\nchapter 93 the castaway\\n\\nit was but some few days after encountering the frenchman that a most\\nsignificant event befell the most insignificant of the pequods crew\\nan event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes\\nmadly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying\\nprophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own\\n\\nnow in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats\\nsome few hands are reserved called shipkeepers whose province it is\\nto work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale as a general\\nthing these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising\\nthe boats crews but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy\\nor timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a\\nshipkeeper it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by\\nnickname pip by abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him before\\nye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight so\\ngloomyjolly\\n\\nin outer aspect pip and doughboy made a match like a black pony and\\na white one of equal developments though of dissimilar colour driven\\nin one eccentric span but while hapless doughboy was by nature dull\\nand torpid in his intellects pip though over tenderhearted was at\\nbottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness\\npeculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and\\nfestivities with finer freer relish than any other race for blacks\\nthe years calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixtyfive\\nfourth of julys and new years days nor smile so while i write that\\nthis little black was brilliant for even blackness has its brilliancy\\nbehold yon lustrous ebony panelled in kings cabinets but pip loved\\nlife and all lifes peaceable securities so that the panicstriking\\nbusiness in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped had\\nmost sadly blurred his brightness though as ere long will be seen\\nwhat was thus temporarily subdued in him in the end was destined to be\\nluridly illumined by strange wild fires that fictitiously showed him\\noff to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tolland\\ncounty in connecticut he had once enlivened many a fiddlers frolic on\\nthe green and at melodious eventide with his gay haha had turned\\nthe round horizon into one starbelled tambourine so though in the\\nclear air of day suspended against a blueveined neck the\\npurewatered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning\\njeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre he\\nlays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun\\nbut by some unnatural gases then come out those fiery effulgences\\ninfernally superb then the evilblazing diamond once the divinest\\nsymbol of the crystal skies looks like some crownjewel stolen from\\nthe king of hell but let us to the story\\n\\nit came to pass that in the ambergris affair stubbs afteroarsman\\nchanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to become quite maimed\\nand temporarily pip was put into his place\\n\\nthe first time stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousness\\nbut happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale and\\ntherefore came off not altogether discreditably though stubb observing\\nhim took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness\\nto the utmost for he might often find it needful\\n\\nnow upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and as\\nthe fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which\\nhappened in this instance to be right under poor pips seat the\\ninvoluntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in\\nhand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale\\nline coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so as\\nto become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water that\\ninstant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line swiftly\\nstraightened and presto poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks of\\nthe boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken\\nseveral turns around his chest and neck\\n\\ntashtego stood in the bows he was full of the fire of the hunt he\\nhated pip for a poltroon snatching the boatknife from its sheath he\\nsuspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubb\\nexclaimed interrogatively cut meantime pips blue choked face\\nplainly looked do for gods sake all passed in a flash in less than\\nhalf a minute this entire thing happened\\n\\ndamn him cut roared stubb and so the whale was lost and pip was\\nsaved\\n\\nso soon as he recovered himself the poor little negro was assailed by\\nyells and execrations from the crew tranquilly permitting these\\nirregular cursings to evaporate stubb then in a plain businesslike\\nbut still half humorous manner cursed pip officially and that done\\nunofficially gave him much wholesome advice the substance was never\\njump from a boat pip exceptbut all the rest was indefinite as the\\nsoundest advice ever is now in general _stick to the boat_ is your\\ntrue motto in whaling but cases will sometimes happen when _leap from\\nthe boat_ is still better moreover as if perceiving at last that if\\nhe should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip he would be\\nleaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly\\ndropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command stick to\\nthe boat pip or by the lord i wont pick you up if you jump mind\\nthat we cant afford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would\\nsell for thirty times what you would pip in alabama bear that in\\nmind and dont jump any more hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted\\nthat though man loved his fellow yet man is a moneymaking animal\\nwhich propensity too often interferes with his benevolence\\n\\nbut we are all in the hands of the gods and pip jumped again it was\\nunder very similar circumstances to the first performance but this\\ntime he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started\\nto run pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried travellers\\ntrunk alas stubb was but too true to his word it was a beautiful\\nbounteous blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatly\\nstretching away all round to the horizon like goldbeaters skin\\nhammered out to the extremest bobbing up and down in that sea pips\\nebon head showed like a head of cloves no boatknife was lifted when\\nhe fell so rapidly astern stubbs inexorable back was turned upon him\\nand the whale was winged in three minutes a whole mile of shoreless\\nocean was between pip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poor\\npip turned his crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely\\ncastaway though the loftiest and the brightest\\n\\nnow in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\\npractised swimmer as to ride in a springcarriage ashore but the awful\\nlonesomeness is intolerable the intense concentration of self in the\\nmiddle of such a heartless immensity my god who can tell it mark\\nhow when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open seamark how closely\\nthey hug their ship and only coast along her sides\\n\\nbut had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate no\\nhe did not mean to at least because there were two boats in his wake\\nand he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to pip\\nvery quickly and pick him up though indeed such considerations\\ntowards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity is not always\\nmanifested by the hunters in all similar instances and such instances\\nnot unfrequently occur almost invariably in the fishery a coward so\\ncalled is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to\\nmilitary navies and armies\\n\\nbut it so happened that those boats without seeing pip suddenly\\nspying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and\\nstubbs boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intent\\nupon his fish that pips ringed horizon began to expand around him\\nmiserably by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him\\nbut from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such\\nat least they said he was the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body\\nup but drowned the infinite of his soul not drowned entirely though\\nrather carried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes of\\nthe unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes\\nand the misermerman wisdom revealed his hoarded heaps and among the\\njoyous heartless everjuvenile eternities pip saw the multitudinous\\ngodomnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters\\nheaved the colossal orbs he saw gods foot upon the treadle of the\\nloom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad so\\nmans insanity is heavens sense and wandering from all mortal reason\\nman comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is\\nabsurd and frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised\\nindifferent as his god\\n\\nfor the rest blame not stubb too hardly the thing is common in that\\nfishery and in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen what\\nlike abandonment befell myself\\n\\n\\nchapter 94 a squeeze of the hand\\n\\nthat whale of stubbs so dearly purchased was duly brought to the\\npequods side where all those cutting and hoisting operations\\npreviously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of\\nthe heidelburgh tun or case\\n\\nwhile some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed in\\ndragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled with the sperm and\\nwhen the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefully manipulated\\nere going to the tryworks of which anon\\n\\nit had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with\\nseveral others i sat down before a large constantines bath of it i\\nfound it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling about\\nin the liquid part it was our business to squeeze these lumps back\\ninto fluid a sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old times this\\nsperm was such a favourite cosmetic such a clearer such a sweetener\\nsuch a softener such a delicious molifier after having my hands in it\\nfor only a few minutes my fingers felt like eels and began as it\\nwere to serpentine and spiralise\\n\\nas i sat there at my ease crosslegged on the deck after the bitter\\nexertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under\\nindolent sail and gliding so serenely along as i bathed my hands\\namong those soft gentle globules of infiltrated tissues woven almost\\nwithin the hour as they richly broke to my fingers and discharged all\\ntheir opulence like fully ripe grapes their wine as i snuffed up that\\nuncontaminated aromaliterally and truly like the smell of spring\\nviolets i declare to you that for the time i lived as in a musky\\nmeadow i forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible\\nsperm i washed my hands and my heart of it i almost began to credit\\nthe old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in\\nallaying the heat of anger while bathing in that bath i felt divinely\\nfree from all illwill or petulance or malice of any sort\\nwhatsoever\\n\\nsqueeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long i squeezed that sperm\\ntill i myself almost melted into it i squeezed that sperm till a\\nstrange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly\\nsqueezing my colaborers hands in it mistaking their hands for the\\ngentle globules such an abounding affectionate friendly loving\\nfeeling did this avocation beget that at last i was continually\\nsqueezing their hands and looking up into their eyes sentimentally as\\nmuch as to sayoh my dear fellow beings why should we longer cherish\\nany social acerbities or know the slightest illhumor or envy come\\nlet us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze ourselves into\\neach other let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and\\nsperm of kindness\\n\\nwould that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever for now since\\nby many prolonged repeated experiences i have perceived that in all\\ncases man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of\\nattainable felicity not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the\\nfancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the\\nfireside the country now that i have perceived all this i am ready\\nto squeeze case eternally in thoughts of the visions of the night i\\nsaw long rows of angels in paradise each with his hands in a jar of\\nspermaceti\\n\\nnow while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things\\nakin to it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the\\ntryworks\\n\\nfirst comes whitehorse so called which is obtained from the tapering\\npart of the fish and also from the thicker portions of his flukes it\\nis tough with congealed tendonsa wad of musclebut still contains some\\noil after being severed from the whale the whitehorse is first cut\\ninto portable oblongs ere going to the mincer they look much like\\nblocks of berkshire marble\\n\\nplumpudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the\\nwhales flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and\\noften participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness it is\\na most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold as its name\\nimports it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked\\nsnowy and golden ground dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and\\npurple it is plums of rubies in pictures of citron spite of reason\\nit is hard to keep yourself from eating it i confess that once i\\nstole behind the foremast to try it it tasted something as i should\\nconceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have\\ntasted supposing him to have been killed the first day after the\\nvenison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an\\nunusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne\\n\\nthere is another substance and a very singular one which turns up in\\nthe course of this business but which i feel it to be very puzzling\\nadequately to describe it is called slobgollion an appellation\\noriginal with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance\\nit is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently found in the\\ntubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting i\\nhold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membranes of the case\\ncoalescing\\n\\ngurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but\\nsometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen it designates the\\ndark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the\\ngreenland or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those\\ninferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan\\n\\nnippers strictly this word is not indigenous to the whales\\nvocabulary but as applied by whalemen it becomes so a whalemans\\nnipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering\\npart of leviathans tail it averages an inch in thickness and for the\\nrest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise moved along\\nthe oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by nameless\\nblandishments as of magic allures along with it all impurities\\n\\nbut to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is at\\nonce to descend into the blubberroom and have a long talk with its\\ninmates this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for\\nthe blanketpieces when stript and hoisted from the whale when the\\nproper time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartment is a\\nscene of terror to all tyros especially by night on one side lit by\\na dull lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen they\\ngenerally go in pairsa pikeandgaffman and a spademan the\\nwhalingpike is similar to a frigates boardingweapon of the same\\nname the gaff is something like a boathook with his gaff the\\ngaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold it from\\nslipping as the ship pitches and lurches about meanwhile the\\nspademan stands on the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it into\\nthe portable horsepieces this spade is sharp as hone can make it the\\nspademans feet are shoeless the thing he stands on will sometimes\\nirresistibly slide away from him like a sledge if he cuts off one of\\nhis own toes or one of his assistants would you be very much\\nastonished toes are scarce among veteran blubberroom men\\n\\n\\nchapter 95 the cassock\\n\\nhad you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this\\npostmortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh the\\nwindlass pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no small\\ncuriosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seen\\nthere lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers not the wondrous\\ncistern in the whales huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower\\njaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so\\nsurprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable conelonger than\\na kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and\\njetblack as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed it\\nis or rather in old times its likeness was such an idol as that\\nfound in the secret groves of queen maachah in judea and for\\nworshipping which king asa her son did depose her and destroyed the\\nidol and burnt it for an abomination at the brook kedron as darkly\\nset forth in the 15th chapter of the first book of kings\\n\\nlook at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along and\\nassisted by two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as the mariners\\ncall it and with bowed shoulders staggers off with it as if he were a\\ngrenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field extending it upon the\\nforecastle deck he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt\\nas an african hunter the pelt of a boa this done he turns the pelt\\ninside out like a pantaloon leg gives it a good stretching so as\\nalmost to double its diameter and at last hangs it well spread in\\nthe rigging to dry ere long it is taken down when removing some\\nthree feet of it towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two\\nslits for armholes at the other end he lengthwise slips himself\\nbodily into it the mincer now stands before you invested in the full\\ncanonicals of his calling immemorial to all his order this\\ninvestiture alone will adequately protect him while employed in the\\npeculiar functions of his office\\n\\nthat office consists in mincing the horsepieces of blubber for the\\npots an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse\\nplanted endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious tub beneath\\nit into which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a rapt\\norators desk arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit\\nintent on bible leaves what a candidate for an archbishopric what a\\nlad for a pope were this mincer\\n\\nbible leaves bible leaves this is the invariable cry from the mates\\nto the mincer it enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into as\\nthin slices as possible inasmuch as by so doing the business of\\nboiling out the oil is much accelerated and its quantity considerably\\nincreased besides perhaps improving it in quality\\n\\n\\nchapter 96 the tryworks\\n\\nbesides her hoisted boats an american whaler is outwardly\\ndistinguished by her tryworks she presents the curious anomaly of the\\nmost solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the\\ncompleted ship it is as if from the open field a brickkiln were\\ntransported to her planks\\n\\nthe tryworks are planted between the foremast and mainmast the most\\nroomy part of the deck the timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength\\nfitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and\\nmortar some ten feet by eight square and five in height the\\nfoundation does not penetrate the deck but the masonry is firmly\\nsecured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all\\nsides and screwing it down to the timbers on the flanks it is cased\\nwith wood and at top completely covered by a large sloping battened\\nhatchway removing this hatch we expose the great trypots two in\\nnumber and each of several barrels capacity when not in use they\\nare kept remarkably clean sometimes they are polished with soapstone\\nand sand till they shine within like silver punchbowls during the\\nnightwatches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil\\nthemselves away there for a nap while employed in polishing themone\\nman in each pot side by sidemany confidential communications are\\ncarried on over the iron lips it is a place also for profound\\nmathematical meditation it was in the left hand trypot of the pequod\\nwith the soapstone diligently circling round me that i was first\\nindirectly struck by the remarkable fact that in geometry all bodies\\ngliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend from\\nany point in precisely the same time\\n\\nremoving the fireboard from the front of the tryworks the bare\\nmasonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouths of\\nthe furnaces directly underneath the pots these mouths are fitted\\nwith heavy doors of iron the intense heat of the fire is prevented\\nfrom communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallow reservoir\\nextending under the entire inclosed surface of the works by a tunnel\\ninserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water as\\nfast as it evaporates there are no external chimneys they open direct\\nfrom the rear wall and here let us go back for a moment\\n\\nit was about nine oclock at night that the pequods tryworks were\\nfirst started on this present voyage it belonged to stubb to oversee\\nthe business\\n\\nall ready there off hatch then and start her you cook fire the\\nworks this was an easy thing for the carpenter had been thrusting\\nhis shavings into the furnace throughout the passage here be it said\\nthat in a whaling voyage the first fire in the tryworks has to be fed\\nfor a time with wood after that no wood is used except as a means of\\nquick ignition to the staple fuel in a word after being tried out\\nthe crisp shrivelled blubber now called scraps or fritters still\\ncontains considerable of its unctuous properties these fritters feed\\nthe flames like a plethoric burning martyr or a selfconsuming\\nmisanthrope once ignited the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by\\nhis own body would that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke is\\nhorrible to inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but you\\nmust live in it for the time it has an unspeakable wild hindoo odor\\nabout it such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres it smells\\nlike the left wing of the day of judgment it is an argument for the\\npit\\n\\nby midnight the works were in full operation we were clear from the\\ncarcase sail had been made the wind was freshening the wild ocean\\ndarkness was intense but that darkness was licked up by the fierce\\nflames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues and\\nilluminated every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed greek\\nfire the burning ship drove on as if remorselessly commissioned to\\nsome vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphurfreighted brigs of the\\nbold hydriote canaris issuing from their midnight harbors with broad\\nsheets of flame for sails bore down upon the turkish frigates and\\nfolded them in conflagrations\\n\\nthe hatch removed from the top of the works now afforded a wide\\nhearth in front of them standing on this were the tartarean shapes of\\nthe pagan harpooneers always the whaleships stokers with huge\\npronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding\\npots or stirred up the fires beneath till the snaky flames darted\\ncurling out of the doors to catch them by the feet the smoke rolled\\naway in sullen heaps to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of\\nthe boiling oil which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces\\nopposite the mouth of the works on the further side of the wide wooden\\nhearth was the windlass this served for a seasofa here lounged the\\nwatch when not otherwise employed looking into the red heat of the\\nfire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads their tawny\\nfeatures now all begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beards\\nand the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these were\\nstrangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works as they\\nnarrated to each other their unholy adventures their tales of terror\\ntold in words of mirth as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards\\nout of them like the flames from the furnace as to and fro in their\\nfront the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged\\nforks and dippers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the\\nship groaned and dived and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further\\nand further into the blackness of the sea and the night and scornfully\\nchamped the white bone in her mouth and viciously spat round her on\\nall sides then the rushing pequod freighted with savages and laden\\nwith fire and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness of\\ndarkness seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commanders\\nsoul\\n\\nso seemed it to me as i stood at her helm and for long hours silently\\nguided the way of this

the tryworks completely\\nhiding the pots every cask is out of sight all tackles are coiled in\\nunseen nooks and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of\\nalmost the entire ships company

at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but in\\nthe multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been\\nadded how that sometimes in these walks when most plunged in his mood\\nhe was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely\\neyeing the particular object before him when he halted before the\\nbinnacle with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the\\ncompass that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of\\nhis purpose and when resuming his walk he again paused before the\\nmainmast then as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted\\ngold coin there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness only\\ndashed with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness\\n\\nbut one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newly\\nattracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it as\\nthough now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in\\nsome monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them and some\\ncertain significance lurks in all things else all things are little\\nworth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell\\nby the cartload as they do hills about boston to fill up some morass\\nin the milky way\\n\\nnow this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out of\\nthe heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over golden sands\\nthe headwaters of many a pactolus flows and though now nailed amidst\\nall the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes\\nyet untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved its\\nquito glow nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour\\npassed by ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with\\nthick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless\\nevery sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last for it\\nwas set apart and sanctified to one awestriking end and however\\nwanton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as\\nthe white whales talisman sometimes they talked it over in the weary\\nwatch by night wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he\\nwould ever live to spend it\\n\\nnow those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the sun\\nand tropic tokenpieces here palms alpacas and volcanoes suns\\ndisks and stars ecliptics hornsofplenty and rich banners waving\\nare in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems\\nalmost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by\\npassing through those fancy mints so spanishly poetic\\n\\nit so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was a most wealthy\\nexample of these things on its round border it bore the letters\\nrepublica del ecuador quito so this bright coin came from a country\\nplanted in the middle of the world and beneath the great equator and\\nnamed after it and it had been cast midway up the andes in the\\nunwaning clime that knows no autumn

nantucket meets the samuel enderby of london\\n\\nship ahoy hast seen the white whale\\n\\nso cried ahab once more hailing a ship showing english colours\\nbearing down under the stern trumpet to mouth the old man was\\nstanding in his hoisted quarterboat his ivory leg plainly revealed to\\nthe stranger captain who was carelessly reclining in his own boats\\nbow he was a darklytanned burly goodnatured finelooking man of\\nsixty or thereabouts dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round\\nhim in festoons of blue pilotcloth and one empty arm of this jacket\\nstreamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussars surcoat\\n\\nhast seen the white whale\\n\\nsee you this and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it\\nhe held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in a wooden\\nhead like a mallet\\n\\nman my boat cried ahab impetuously and tossing about the oars near\\nhimstand by to lower\\n\\nin less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and his\\ncrew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of the\\nstranger but here a curious difficulty presented itself in the\\nexcitement of the moment ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his\\nleg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his\\nown and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical\\ncontrivance peculiar to the pequod and a thing not to be rigged and\\nshipped in any other vessel at a moments warning now it is no very\\neasy matter for anybodyexcept those who are almost hourly used to it\\nlike whalemento clamber up a ships side from a boat on the open sea\\nfor the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks\\nand then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson so\\ndeprived of one leg and the strange ship of course being altogether\\nunsupplied with the kindly invention ahab now found himself abjectly\\nreduced to a clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain\\nchangeful height he could hardly hope to attain\\n\\nit has before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward\\ncircumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his\\nluckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab and\\nin the present instance all this was heightened by the sight of the\\ntwo officers of the strange ship leaning over the side by the\\nperpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a\\npair of tastefullyornamented manropes for at first they did not seem\\nto bethink them that a onelegged man must be too much of a cripple to\\nuse their sea bannisters but this awkwardness only lasted a minute\\nbecause the strange captain observing at a glance how affairs stood\\ncried out i see i seeavast heaving there jump boys and swing\\nover the cuttingtackle\\n\\nas good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two\\nprevious and the great tackles were still aloft and the massive\\ncurved blubberhook now clean and dry was still attached to the end\\nthis was quickly lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it all\\nslid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sitting\\nin the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then\\ngiving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to\\nhoist his own weight by pulling handoverhand upon one of the running\\nparts of the tackle soon he was carefully swung inside the high\\nbulwarks and gently landed upon the capstan head with his ivory arm\\nfrankly thrust forth in welcome the other captain advanced and ahab\\nputting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like two\\nswordfish blades cried out in his walrus way aye aye hearty let\\nus shake bones togetheran arm and a legan arm that never can\\nshrink dye see and a leg that never can run where didst thou see\\nthe white whalehow long ago\\n\\nthe white whale said the englishman pointing his ivory arm towards\\nthe east and taking a rueful sight along it as if it had been a\\ntelescope there i saw him on the line last season\\n\\nand he took that arm off did he asked ahab now sliding down from\\nthe capstan and resting on the englishmans shoulder as he did so\\n\\naye he was the cause of it at least and that leg too\\n\\nspin me the yarn said ahab how was it\\n\\nit was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line\\nbegan the englishman i was ignorant of the white whale at that time\\nwell one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales and my boat\\nfastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too that went\\nmilling and milling round so that my boats crew could only trim dish\\nby sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale presently up breaches\\nfrom the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milkywhite\\nhead and hump all crows feet and wrinkles\\n\\nit was he it was he cried ahab suddenly letting out his suspended\\nbreath\\n\\nand harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin\\n\\naye ayethey were mine_my_ irons cried ahab exultinglybut on\\n\\ngive me a chance then said the englishman goodhumoredly well\\nthis old greatgrandfather with the white head and hump runs all\\nafoam into the pod and goes to snapping furiously at my fastline\\n\\naye i seewanted to part it free the fastfishan old tricki know\\nhim\\n\\nhow it was exactly continued the onearmed commander i do not\\nknow but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there\\nsomehow but we didnt know it then so that when we afterwards pulled\\non the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other\\nwhales that went off to windward all fluking seeing how matters\\nstood and what a noble great whale it wasthe noblest and biggest i\\never saw sir in my lifei resolved to capture him spite of the\\nboiling rage he seemed to be in and thinking the haphazard line would\\nget loose or the tooth it was tangled to might draw for i have a\\ndevil of a boats crew for a pull on a whaleline seeing all this i\\nsay i jumped into my first mates boatmr mounttops here by the\\nway captainmounttop mounttopthe captainas i was saying i jumped\\ninto mounttops boat which dye see was gunwale and gunwale with\\nmine then and snatching the first harpoon let this old\\ngreatgrandfather have it but lord look you sirhearts and souls\\nalive manthe next instant in a jiff i was blind as a batboth eyes\\noutall befogged and bedeadened with black foamthe whales tail\\nlooming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble\\nsteeple no use sterning all then but as i was groping at midday\\nwith a blinding sun all crownjewels as i was groping i say after\\nthe second iron to toss it overboarddown comes the tail like a lima\\ntower cutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinters and\\nflukes first the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was\\nall chips we all struck out to escape his terrible flailings i\\nseized hold of my harpoonpole sticking in him and for a moment clung\\nto that like a sucking fish but a combing sea dashed me off and at\\nthe same instant the fish taking one good dart forwards went down\\nlike a flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near\\nme caught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder yes\\ncaught me just here i say and bore me down to hells flames i was\\nthinking when when all of a sudden thank the good god the barb\\nript its way along the fleshclear along the whole length of my\\narmcame out nigh my wrist and up i floatedand that gentleman there\\nwill tell you the rest by the

near them with nothing specific visible to denote\\nhis gentlemanly rank on board his face was an exceedingly round but\\nsober one he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and\\npatched trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attention between\\na marlingspike he held in one hand and a pillbox held in the other\\noccasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two\\ncrippled captains but at his superiors introduction of him to ahab\\nhe politely bowed and straightway went on to do his captains bidding\\n\\nit was a shocking bad wound began the whalesurgeon and taking my\\nadvice captain boomer here stood our old sammy\\n\\nsamuel enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the onearmed\\ncaptain addressing ahab go on boy\\n\\nstood our old sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazing\\nhot weather there on the line but it was no usei did all i could sat\\nup with him nights was very severe with him in the matter of diet\\n\\noh very severe chimed in the patient himself then suddenly\\naltering his voice drinking hot rum toddies with me every night till\\nhe couldnt see to put on the bandages and sending me to bed half\\nseas over about three oclock in the morning oh ye stars he sat up\\nwith me indeed and was very severe in my diet oh a great watcher\\nand very dietetically severe is dr bunger bunger you dog laugh\\nout why dont ye you know youre a precious jolly rascal but heave\\nahead boy id rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other\\nman\\n\\nmy captain you must have ere this perceived respected sirsaid the\\nimperturbable godlylooking bunger slightly bowing to ahabis apt to\\nbe facetious at times he spins us many clever things of that sort but\\ni may as well sayen passant as the french remarkthat i myselfthat\\nis to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergyam a strict total\\nabstinence man i never drink\\n\\nwater cried the captain he never drinks it its a sort of fits to\\nhim fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia but go ongo on with\\nthe arm story\\n\\nyes i may as well said the surgeon coolly i was about observing\\nsir before captain boomers facetious interruption that spite of my\\nbest and severest endeavors the wound kept getting worse and worse\\nthe truth was sir it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw\\nmore than two feet and several inches long i measured it with the lead\\nline in short it grew black i knew what was threatened and off it\\ncame but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there that thing is\\nagainst all rulepointing at it with the marlingspikethat is the\\ncaptains work not mine he ordered the carpenter to make it he had\\nthat clubhammer there put to the end to knock some ones brains out\\nwith i suppose as he tried mine once he flies into diabolical\\npassions sometimes do ye see this dent sirremoving his hat and\\nbrushing aside his hair and exposing a bowllike cavity in his skull\\nbut which bore not the slightest scarry trace or any token of ever\\nhaving been a woundwell the captain there will tell you how that\\ncame here he knows\\n\\nno i dont said the captain but his mother did he was born with\\nit oh you solemn rogue youyou bunger was there ever such another\\nbunger in the watery world bunger when you die you ought to die in\\npickle you dog you should be preserved to future ages you rascal\\n\\nwhat became of the white whale now cried ahab who thus far had been\\nimpatiently listening to this byplay between the two englishmen\\n\\noh cried the onearmed captain oh yes well after he sounded we\\ndidnt see him again for some time in fact as i before hinted i\\ndidnt then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick\\ntill some time afterwards when coming back to the line we heard about\\nmoby dickas some call himand then i knew it was he\\n\\ndidst thou cross his wake again\\n\\ntwice\\n\\nbut could not fasten\\n\\ndidnt want to try to aint one limb enough what should i do without\\nthis other arm and im thinking moby dick doesnt bite so much as he\\nswallows\\n\\nwell then interrupted bunger give him your left arm for bait to\\nget the right do you know gentlemenvery gravely and mathematically\\nbowing to each captain in successiondo you know gentlemen that the\\ndigestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine\\nprovidence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest\\neven a mans arm and he knows it too so that what you take for the\\nwhite whales malice is only his awkwardness for he never means to\\nswallow a single limb he only thinks to terrify by feints but\\nsometimes he is like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of\\nmine in ceylon that making believe swallow jackknives once upon a\\ntime let one drop into him in good earnest and there it stayed for a\\ntwelvemonth or more when i gave him an emetic and he heaved it up in\\nsmall tacks dye see no possible way for him to digest that\\njackknife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system\\nyes captain boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind\\nto pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial\\nto the other why in that case the arm is yours only let the whale\\nhave another chance at you shortly thats all\\n\\nno thank ye bunger said the english captain hes welcome to the\\narm he has since i cant help it and didnt know him then but not to\\nanother one no more white whales for me ive lowered for him once\\nand that has satisfied me there would be great glory in killing him i\\nknow that and there is a shipload of precious sperm in him but hark\\nye hes best let alone dont you think so captainglancing at the\\nivory leg\\n\\nhe is but he will still be hunted for all that what is best let\\nalone that accursed thing is not always what least allures hes all a\\nmagnet how long since thou sawst him last which way heading\\n\\nbless my soul and curse the foul fiends cried bunger stoopingly\\nwalking round ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this mans\\nbloodbring the thermometerits at the boiling pointhis pulse makes\\nthese planks beatsirtaking a lancet from his pocket and drawing\\nnear to ahabs arm\\n\\navast roared ahab dashing him against the bulwarksman the boat\\nwhich way heading\\n\\ngood god cried the english captain to whom the question was put\\nwhats the matter he was heading east i thinkis your captain\\ncrazy whispering fedallah\\n\\nbut fedallah putting a finger on his lip slid over the bulwarks to\\ntake the boats steering oar and ahab swinging the cuttingtackle\\ntowards him commanded the ships sailors to stand by to lower\\n\\nin a moment he was standing in the boats stern and the manilla men\\nwere springing to their oars in vain the english captain hailed him\\nwith back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own\\nahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod\\n\\n\\nchapter 101 the decanter\\n\\nere the english ship fades from sight be it set down here that she\\nhailed from london and was named after the late samuel enderby\\nmerchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of\\nenderby  sons a house which in my poor whalemans opinion comes not\\nfar behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons in point\\nof real historical interest how long prior to the year of our lord\\n1775 this great whaling house was in existence my numerous\\nfishdocuments do not make plain but in that year 1775 it fitted out\\nthe first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale\\nthough for some score of years previous ever since 1726 our valiant\\ncoffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleets\\npursued that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not\\nelsewhere be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers were\\nthe first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm\\nwhale and that for half a century they were the only people of the\\nwhole globe who so harpooned him\\n\\nin 1778 a fine ship the amelia fitted out for the express purpose\\nand at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly rounded cape\\nhorn and was the first among the nations to lower a whaleboat of any\\nsort in the great south sea the voyage was a skilful and lucky one\\nand returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm\\nthe amelias example was soon followed by other ships english and\\namerican and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were\\nthrown open but not content with this good deed the indefatigable\\nhouse again bestirred itself samuel and all his sonshow many their\\nmother only knowsand under their immediate auspices and partly i\\nthink at their expense the british government was induced to send the\\nsloopofwar rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south\\nsea commanded by a naval postcaptain the rattler made a rattling\\nvoyage of it and did some service how much does not appear but this\\nis not all in 1819 the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship\\nof their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan\\nthat shipwell called the syrenmade a noble experimental cruise and\\nit was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first became\\ngenerally known the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a\\ncaptain coffin a nantucketer\\n\\nall honor to the enderbies therefore whose house i think exists to\\nthe present day though doubtless the original samuel must long ago\\nhave slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world\\n\\nthe ship named after him was worthy of the honor being a very fast\\nsailer and a noble craft every way i boarded her once at midnight\\nsomewhere off the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the\\nforecastle it was a fine gam we had and they were all trumpsevery\\nsoul on board a short life to them and a jolly death and that fine\\ngam i hadlong very long after old ahab touched her planks with his\\nivory heelit minds me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that\\nship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if i ever\\nlose sight of it flip did i say we had flip yes and we flipped it\\nat the rate of ten gallons the hour and when the squall came for its\\nsqually off there by patagonia and all handsvisitors and allwere\\ncalled to reef topsails we were so topheavy that we had to swing each\\nother aloft in bowlines and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our\\njackets into the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the\\nhowling gale a warning example to all drunken tars however the masts\\ndid not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that\\nwe had to pass the flip again though the savage salt spray bursting\\ndown the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to\\nmy taste\\n\\nthe beef was finetough but with body in it they said it was\\nbullbeef others that it was dromedary beef but i do not know for\\ncertain how that was they had dumplings too small but substantial\\nsymmetrically globular and indestructible dumplings i fancied that\\nyou could feel them and roll them about in you after they were\\nswallowed if you stooped over too far forward you risked their\\npitching out of you like billiardballs the breadbut that couldnt be\\nhelped besides it was an antiscorbutic in short the bread\\ncontained the only fresh fare they had but the forecastle was not very\\nlight and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you\\nate it but all in all taking her from truck to helm considering the\\ndimensions of the cooks boilers including his own live parchment\\nboilers fore and aft i say the samuel enderby was a jolly ship of\\ngood fare and plenty fine flip and strong crack fellows all and\\ncapital from boot heels to hatband\\n\\nbut why was it think ye that the samuel enderby and some other\\nenglish whalers i know ofnot all thoughwere such famous hospitable\\nships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the\\njoke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing i\\nwill tell you the abounding good cheer of these english whalers is\\nmatter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing of\\nhistorical whale research when it has seemed needed\\n\\nthe english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders\\nzealanders and danes from whom they derived many terms still extant\\nin the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashions touching\\nplenty to eat and drink for as a general thing the english\\nmerchantship scrimps her crew but not so the english whaler hence\\nin the english this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and\\nnatural but incidental and particular and therefore must have some\\nspecial origin which is here pointed out and will be still further\\nelucidated\\n\\nduring my researches in the leviathanic histories i stumbled upon an\\nancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it i knew\\nmust be about whalers the title was dan coopman wherefore i\\nconcluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam\\ncooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper i was\\nreinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one\\nfitz swackhammer but my friend dr snodhead a very learned man\\nprofessor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus\\nand st potts to whom i handed the work for translation giving him a\\nbox of sperm candles for his troublethis same dr snodhead so soon as\\nhe spied the book assured me that dan coopman did not mean the\\ncooper but the merchant in short this ancient and learned low\\ndutch book treated of the commerce of holland and among other\\nsubjects contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery\\nand in this chapter it was headed smeer or fat that i found a\\nlong detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180\\nsail of dutch whalemen from which list as translated by dr snodhead\\ni transcribe the following\\n\\n400000 lbs of beef 60000 lbs friesland pork 150000 lbs of stock\\nfish 550000 lbs of biscuit 72000 lbs of soft bread 2800 firkins\\nof butter 20000 lbs texel  leyden cheese 144000 lbs cheese\\nprobably an inferior article 550 ankers of geneva 10800 barrels of\\nbeer\\n\\nmost statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so in\\nthe present case however where the reader is flooded with whole\\npipes barrels quarts and gills of good gin and good cheer\\n\\nat the time i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this\\nbeer beef and bread during which many profound thoughts were\\nincidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendental and platonic\\napplication and furthermore i compiled supplementary tables of my\\nown touching the probable quantity of stockfish etc consumed by\\nevery low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen\\nwhale fishery in the first place the amount of butter and texel and\\nleyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to their\\nnaturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by the\\nnature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game\\nin those frigid polar seas on the very coasts of that esquimaux\\ncountry where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of\\ntrain oil\\n\\nthe quantity of beer too is very large 10800 barrels now as those\\npolar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that\\nclimate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen\\nincluding the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea did not\\nmuch exceed three months say and reckoning 30 men to each of their\\nfleet of 180 sail we have 5400 low dutch seamen in all therefore i\\nsay we have precisely two barrels of beer per man for a twelve weeks\\nallowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin\\nnow whether these gin and beer harpooneers so fuddled as one might\\nfancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a\\nboats head and take good aim at flying whales this would seem\\nsomewhat improbable yet they did aim at them and hit them too but\\nthis was very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well with\\nthe constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer would\\nbe apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the masthead and boozy in his\\nboat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford\\n\\nbut no more enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers of\\ntwo or three centuries ago were high livers and that the english\\nwhalers have not neglected so excellent an example for say they when\\ncruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of the\\nworld get a good dinner out of it at least and this empties the\\ndecanter\\n\\n\\nchapter 102 a bower in the arsacides\\n\\nhitherto in descriptively treating of the sperm whale i have chiefly\\ndwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separately and in detail\\nupon some few interior structural features but to a large and thorough\\nsweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now to unbutton him still\\nfurther and untagging the points of his hose unbuckling his garters\\nand casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost\\nbones set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in his\\nunconditional skeleton\\n\\nbut how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman in the\\nfishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the\\nwhale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lectures\\non the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a\\nspecimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can you land a\\nfullgrown whale on your deck for examination as a cook dishes a\\nroastpig surely not a veritable witness have you hitherto been\\nishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone\\nthe privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the rafters\\nridgepole sleepers and underpinnings making up the framework of\\nleviathan and belike of the tallowvats dairyrooms butteries and\\ncheeseries in his bowels\\n\\ni confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far\\nbeneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have been blessed\\nwith an opportunity to dissect him in miniature in a ship i belonged\\nto a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his\\npoke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and for the\\nheads of the lances think you i let that chance go without using my\\nboathatchet and jackknife and breaking the seal and reading all the\\ncontents of that young cub\\n\\nand as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their\\ngigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge i am indebted\\nto my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides\\nfor being at tranque years ago when attached to the tradingship dey\\nof algiers i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with\\nthe lord of tranque at his retired palm villa at pupella a seaside\\nglen not very far distant from what our sailors called bambootown his\\ncapital\\n\\namong many other fine qualities my royal friend tranquo being gifted\\nwith a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had brought\\ntogether in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his\\npeople could invent chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices\\nchiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes and\\nall these distributed among whatever natural wonders the\\nwonderfreighted tributerendering waves had cast upon his shores\\n\\nchief among these latter was a great sperm whale which after an\\nunusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his\\nhead against a cocoanut tree whose plumagelike tufted droopings\\nseemed his verdant jet when the vast body had at last been stripped of\\nits fathomdeep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry in the sun\\nthen the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen where\\na grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it\\n\\nthe ribs were hung with trophies the vertebræ were carved with\\narsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priests\\nkept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head again\\nsent forth its vapory spout while suspended from a bough the\\nterrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees like the hairhung\\nsword that so affrighted damocles\\n\\nit was a wondrous sight the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen\\nthe trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the\\nindustrious earth beneath was as a weavers loom with a gorgeous\\ncarpet on it whereof the groundvine tendrils formed the warp and\\nwoof and the living flowers the figures all the trees with all their\\nladen branches all the shrubs and ferns and grasses the\\nmessagecarrying air all these unceasingly were active through the\\nlacings of the leaves the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving\\nthe unwearied verdure oh busy weaver unseen weaverpauseone\\nwordwhither flows the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore all\\nthese ceaseless toilings speak weaverstay thy handbut one single\\nword with thee naythe shuttle fliesthe figures float from forth the\\nloom the freshetrushing carpet for ever slides away the weavergod\\nhe weaves and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal\\nvoice and by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened\\nand only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak\\nthrough it for even so it is in all material factories the spoken\\nwords that are inaudible among the flying spindles those same words\\nare plainly heard without the walls bursting from the opened\\ncasements thereby have villainies been detected ah mortal then be\\nheedful for so in all this din of the great worlds loom thy\\nsubtlest thinkings may be overheard afar\\n\\nnow amid the green liferestless loom of that arsacidean wood the\\ngreat white worshipped skeleton lay lounginga gigantic idler yet\\nas the everwoven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around\\nhim the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven over\\nwith the vines every month assuming greener fresher verdure but\\nhimself a skeleton life folded death death trellised life the grim\\ngod wived with youthful life and begat him curlyheaded glories\\n\\nnow when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw the\\nskull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real\\njet had issued i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an\\nobject of vertu he laughed but more i marvelled that the priests\\nshould swear that smoky jet of his was genuine to and fro i paced\\nbefore this skeletonbrushed the vines asidebroke through the ribsand\\nwith a ball of arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid its many\\nwinding shaded colonnades and arbours but soon my line was out and\\nfollowing it back i emerged from the opening where i entered i saw no\\nliving thing within naught was there but bones\\n\\ncutting me a green measuringrod i once more dived within the\\nskeleton from their arrowslit in the skull the priests perceived me\\ntaking the altitude of the final rib how now they shouted darst\\nthou measure this our god thats for us aye priestswell how long\\ndo ye make him then but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them\\nconcerning feet and inches they cracked each others sconces with\\ntheir yardsticksthe great skull echoedand seizing that lucky chance\\ni quickly concluded my own admeasurements\\n\\nthese admeasurements i now propose to set before you but first be it\\nrecorded that in this matter i am not free to utter any fancied\\nmeasurement i please because there are skeleton authorities you can\\nrefer to to test my accuracy there is a leviathanic museum they tell\\nme in hull england one of the whaling ports of that country where\\nthey have some fine specimens of finbacks and other whales likewise\\ni have heard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire they\\nhave what the proprietors call the only perfect specimen of a\\ngreenland or river whale in the united states moreover at a place in\\nyorkshire england burton constable by name a certain sir clifford\\nconstable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of\\nmoderate size by no means of the fullgrown magnitude of my friend\\nking tranquos\\n\\nin both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletons\\nbelonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar\\ngrounds king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and sir\\nclifford because he was lord of the seignories of those parts sir\\ncliffords whale has been articulated throughout so that like a great\\nchest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bony\\ncavitiesspread out his ribs like a gigantic fanand swing all day upon\\nhis lower jaw locks are to be put upon some of his trapdoors and\\nshutters and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of\\nkeys at his side sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep\\nat the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the\\necho in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled\\nview from his forehead\\n\\nthe skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied\\nverbatim from my right arm where i had them tattooed as in my wild\\nwanderings at that period there was no other secure way of preserving\\nsuch valuable statistics but as i was crowded for space and wished\\nthe other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was then\\ncomposingat least what untattooed parts might remaini did not\\ntrouble myself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at all\\nenter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale\\n\\n\\nchapter 103 measurement of the whales skeleton\\n\\nin the first place i wish to lay before you a particular plain\\nstatement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton\\nwe are briefly to exhibit such a statement may prove useful here\\n\\naccording to a careful calculation i have made and which i partly base\\nupon captain scoresbys estimate of seventy tons for the largest sized\\ngreenland whale of sixty feet in length according to my careful\\ncalculation i say a sperm whale of the largest magnitude between\\neightyfive and ninety feet in length and something less than forty\\nfeet in its fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at least\\nninety tons so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would\\nconsiderably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one\\nthousand one hundred inhabitants\\n\\nthink you not then that brains like yoked cattle should be put to\\nthis leviathan to make him at all budge to any landsmans imagination\\n\\nhaving already in various ways put before you his skull spouthole\\njaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts i shall now\\nsimply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\\nunobstructed bones but as the colossal skull embraces so very large a\\nproportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by far the\\nmost complicated part and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it\\nin this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under\\nyour arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion\\nof the general structure we are about to view\\n\\nin length the sperm whales skeleton at tranque measured seventytwo\\nfeet so that when fully invested and extended in life he must have\\nbeen ninety feet long for in the whale the skeleton loses about one\\nfifth in length compared with the living body of this seventytwo\\nfeet his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet leaving some fifty\\nfeet of plain backbone attached to this backbone for something less\\nthan a third of its length was the mighty circular basket of ribs\\nwhich once enclosed his vitals\\n\\nto me this vast ivoryribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine\\nextending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembled\\nthe hull of a great ship newlaid upon the stocks when only some\\ntwenty of her naked bowribs are inserted and the keel is otherwise\\nfor the time but a long disconnected timber\\n\\nthe ribs were ten on a side the first to begin from the neck was\\nnearly six feet long the second third and fourth were each\\nsuccessively longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or one\\nof the middle ribs which measured eight feet and some inches from\\nthat part the remaining ribs diminished till the tenth and last only\\nspanned five feet and some inches in general thickness they all bore\\na seemly correspondence to their length the middle ribs were the most\\narched in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay\\nfootpath bridges over small streams\\n\\nin considering these ribs i could not but be struck anew with the\\ncircumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton of\\nthe whale is by no means the mould of his invested form the largest of\\nthe tranque ribs one of the middle ones occupied that part of the\\nfish which in life is greatest in depth now the greatest depth of\\nthe invested body of this particular whale must have been at least\\nsixteen feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more\\nthan eight feet so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion\\nof the living magnitude of that part besides for some way where i\\nnow saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with\\ntons of added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowels still more for\\nthe ample fins i here saw but a few disordered joints and in place of\\nthe weighty and majestic but boneless flukes an utter blank\\n\\nhow vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravelled man to try\\nto comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his\\ndead attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood no only in\\nthe heart of quickest perils only when within the eddyings of his\\nangry flukes only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully\\ninvested whale be truly and livingly found out\\n\\nbut the spine for that the best way we can consider it is with a\\ncrane to pile its bones high up on end no speedy enterprise but now\\nits done it looks much like pompeys pillar\\n\\nthere are forty and odd vertebræ in all which in the skeleton are not\\nlocked together they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a\\ngothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry the largest a\\nmiddle one is in width something less than three feet and in depth\\nmore than four the smallest where the spine tapers away into the\\ntail is only two inches in width and looks something like a white\\nbilliardball i was told that there were still smaller ones but they\\nhad been lost by some little cannibal urchins the priests children\\nwho had stolen them to play marbles with thus we see how that the\\nspine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into\\nsimple childs play\\n\\n\\nchapter 104 the fossil whale\\n\\nfrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon\\nto enlarge amplify and generally expatiate would you you could not\\ncompress him by good rights he should only be treated of in imperial\\nfolio not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail and\\nthe yards he measures about the waist only think of the gigantic\\ninvolutions of his intestines where they lie in him like great cables\\nand hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlopdeck of a\\nlineofbattleship\\n\\nsince i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan it behooves me to\\napprove myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not\\noverlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning him\\nout to the uttermost coil of his bowels having already described him\\nin most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities it now\\nremains to magnify him in an archæological fossiliferous and\\nantediluvian point of view applied to any other creature than the\\nleviathanto an ant or a fleasuch portly terms might justly be deemed\\nunwarrantably grandiloquent but when leviathan is the text the case\\nis altered fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest\\nwords of the dictionary and here be it said that whenever it has been\\nconvenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations i have\\ninvariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson expressly purchased\\nfor that purpose because that famous lexicographers uncommon personal\\nbulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author\\nlike me\\n\\none often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject\\nthough it may seem but an ordinary one how then with me writing of\\nthis leviathan unconsciously my chirography expands into placard\\ncapitals give me a condors quill give me vesuvius crater for an\\ninkstand friends hold my arms for in the mere act of penning my\\nthoughts of this leviathan they weary me and make me faint with their\\noutreaching comprehensiveness of sweep as if to include the whole\\ncircle of the sciences and all the generations of whales and men and\\nmastodons past present and to come with all the revolving panoramas\\nof empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not excluding\\nits suburbs such and so magnifying is the virtue of a large and\\nliberal theme we expand to its bulk to produce a mighty book you\\nmust choose a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can ever be\\nwritten on the flea though many there be who have tried it\\n\\nere entering upon the subject of fossil whales i present my\\ncredentials as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time i\\nhave been a stonemason and also a great digger of ditches canals and\\nwells winevaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts likewise by\\nway of preliminary i desire to remind the reader that while in the\\nearlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now\\nalmost completely extinct the subsequent relics discovered in what are\\ncalled the tertiary formations seem the connecting or at any rate\\nintercepted links between the antichronical creatures and those whose\\nremote posterity are said to have entered the ark all the fossil\\nwhales hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period which is the\\nlast preceding the superficial formations and though none of them\\nprecisely answer to any known species of the present time they are yet\\nsufficiently akin to them in general respects to justify their taking\\nrank as cetacean fossils\\n\\ndetached broken fossils of preadamite whales fragments of their bones\\nand skeletons have within thirty years past at various intervals\\nbeen found at the base of the alps in lombardy in france in england\\nin scotland and in the states of louisiana mississippi and alabama\\namong the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the\\nyear 1779 was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris a short street\\nopening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries and bones\\ndisinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp in napoleons\\ntime cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some\\nutterly unknown leviathanic species\\n\\nbut by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost\\ncomplete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year 1842\\non the plantation of judge creagh in alabama the awestricken\\ncredulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the\\nfallen angels the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile and\\nbestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus but some specimen bones of\\nit being taken across the sea to owen the english anatomist it turned\\nout that this alleged reptile was a whale though of a departed\\nspecies a significant illustration of the fact again and again\\nrepeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but\\nlittle clue to the shape of his fully invested body so owen\\nrechristened the monster zeuglodon and in his paper read before the\\nlondon geological society pronounced it in substance one of the most\\nextraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted\\nout of existence\\n\\nwhen i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons skulls tusks\\njaws ribs and vertebræ all characterized by partial resemblances to\\nthe existing breeds of seamonsters but at the same time bearing on\\nthe other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical\\nleviathans their incalculable seniors i am by a flood borne back to\\nthat wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begun for\\ntime began with man here saturns grey chaos rolls over me and i\\nobtain dim shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities when\\nwedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics and\\nin all the 25000 miles of this worlds circumference not an\\ninhabitable hands breadth of land was visible then the whole world\\nwas the whales and king of creation he left his wake along the\\npresent lines of the andes and the himmalehs who can show a pedigree\\nlike leviathan ahabs harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaohs\\nmethuselah seems a schoolboy i look round to shake hands with shem i\\nam horrorstruck at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the\\nunspeakable terrors of the whale which having been before all time\\nmust needs exist after all humane ages are over\\n\\nbut not alone has this leviathan left his preadamite traces in the\\nstereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed his\\nancient bust but upon egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems to claim\\nfor them an almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakable\\nprint of his fin in an apartment of the great temple of denderah some\\nfifty years ago there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a\\nsculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaurs griffins\\nand dolphins similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe\\nof the moderns gliding among them old leviathan swam as of yore was\\nthere swimming in that planisphere centuries before solomon was\\ncradled\\n\\nnor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity\\nof the whale in his own osseous postdiluvian reality as set down by\\nthe venerable john leo the old barbary traveller\\n\\nnot far from the seaside they have a temple the rafters and beams\\nof which are made of whalebones for whales of a monstrous size are\\noftentimes cast up dead upon that shore the common people imagine\\nthat by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple no whale can\\npass it without immediate death but the truth of the matter is that\\non either side of the temple there are rocks that shoot two miles into\\nthe sea and wound the whales when they light upon em they keep a\\nwhales rib of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon the\\nground with its convex part uppermost makes an arch the head of which\\ncannot be reached by a man upon a camels back this rib says john\\nleo is said to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it their\\nhistorians affirm that a prophet who prophesyd of mahomet came from\\nthis temple and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonas\\nwas cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple\\n\\nin this afric temple of the whale i leave you reader and if you be a\\nnantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship there\\n\\n\\nchapter 105 does the whales magnitude diminishwill he perish\\n\\ninasmuch then as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us from\\nthe headwaters of the eternities it may be fitly inquired whether\\nin the long course of his generations he has not degenerated from the\\noriginal bulk of his sires\\n\\nbut upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of the\\npresent day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are\\nfound in the tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period\\nprior to man but of the whales found in that tertiary system those\\nbelonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier\\nones\\n\\nof all the preadamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is the\\nalabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less than\\nseventy feet in length in the skeleton whereas we have already seen\\nthat the tapemeasure gives seventytwo feet for the skeleton of a\\nlarge sized modern whale and i have heard on whalemens authority\\nthat sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the\\ntime of capture\\n\\nbut may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are an\\nadvance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods may\\nit not be that since adams time they have degenerated\\n\\nassuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the accounts of\\nsuch gentlemen as pliny and the ancient naturalists generally for\\npliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk and\\naldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in lengthrope\\nwalks and thames tunnels of whales and even in the days of banks and\\nsolander cookes naturalists we find a danish member of the academy\\nof sciences setting down certain iceland whales reydansiskur or\\nwrinkled bellies at one hundred and twenty yards that is three\\nhundred and sixty feet and lacépède the french naturalist in his\\nelaborate history of whales in the very beginning of his work page\\n3 sets down the right whale at one hundred metres three hundred and\\ntwentyeight feet and this work was published so late as ad 1825\\n\\nbut will any whaleman believe these stories no the whale of today is\\nas big as his ancestors in plinys time and if ever i go where pliny\\nis i a whaleman more than he was will make bold to tell him so\\nbecause i cannot understand how it is that while the egyptian mummies\\nthat were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born do not\\nmeasure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socks\\nand while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest\\negyptian and nineveh tablets by the relative proportions in which they\\nare drawn just as plainly prove that the highbred stallfed prize\\ncattle of smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the\\nfattest of pharaohs fat kine in the face of all this i will not\\nadmit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated\\n\\nbut still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the more\\nrecondite nantucketers whether owing to the almost omniscient\\nlookouts at the mastheads of the whaleships now penetrating even\\nthrough behrings straits and into the remotest secret drawers and\\nlockers of the world and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along\\nall continental coasts the moot point is whether leviathan can long\\nendure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must not\\nat last be exterminated from the waters and the last whale like the\\nlast man smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the final\\npuff\\n\\ncomparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo\\nwhich not forty years ago overspread by tens of thousands the\\nprairies of illinois and missouri and shook their iron manes and\\nscowled with their thunderclotted brows upon the sites of populous\\nrivercapitals where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar\\nan inch in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem\\nfurnished to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy\\nextinction\\n\\nbut you must look at this matter in every light though so short a\\nperiod agonot a good lifetimethe census of the buffalo in illinois\\nexceeded the census of men now in london and though at the present day\\nnot one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region and though the\\ncause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man yet the far\\ndifferent nature of the whalehunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious\\nan end to the leviathan forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whales\\nfor fortyeight months think they have done extremely well and thank\\ngod if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish whereas in the\\ndays of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west\\nwhen the far west in whose sunset suns still rise was a wilderness\\nand a virgin the same number of moccasined men for the same number of\\nmonths mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships would have slain\\nnot forty but forty thousand and more buffaloes a fact that if need\\nwere could be statistically stated\\n\\nnor considered aright does it seem any argument in favour of the\\ngradual extinction of the sperm whale for example that in former\\nyears the latter part of the last century say these leviathans in\\nsmall pods were encountered much oftener than at present and in\\nconsequence the voyages were not so prolonged and were also much more\\nremunerative because as has been elsewhere noticed those whales\\ninfluenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immense\\ncaravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes\\nand pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but\\nwidely separated unfrequent armies that is all and equally\\nfallacious seems the conceit that because the socalled whalebone\\nwhales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with\\nthem hence that species also is declining for they are only being\\ndriven from promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivened\\nwith their jets then be sure some other and remoter strand has been\\nvery recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle\\n\\nfurthermore concerning these last mentioned leviathans they have two\\nfirm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain\\nimpregnable and as upon the invasion of their valleys the frosty\\nswiss have retreated to their mountains so hunted from the savannas\\nand glades of the middle seas the whalebone whales can at last resort\\nto their polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers\\nand walls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed\\ncircle of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man\\n\\nbut as perhaps fifty of these whalebone whales are harpooned for one\\ncachalot some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this\\npositive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions\\nbut though for some time past a number of these whales not less than\\n13000 have been annually slain on the nor west coast by the\\namericans alone yet there are considerations which render even this\\ncircumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this\\nmatter\\n\\nnatural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness\\nof the more enormous creatures of the globe yet what shall we say to\\nharto the historian of goa when he tells us that at one hunting the\\nking of siam took 4000 elephants that in those regions elephants are\\nnumerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes and there seems\\nno reason to doubt that if these elephants which have now been hunted\\nfor thousands of years by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all\\nthe successive monarchs of the eastif they still survive there in\\ngreat numbers much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since\\nhe has a pasture to expatiate in which is precisely twice as large as\\nall asia both americas europe and africa new holland and all the\\nisles of the sea combined\\n\\nmoreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity of\\nwhales their probably attaining the age of a century and more\\ntherefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generations\\nmust be contemporary and what that is we may soon gain some idea of\\nby imagining all the graveyards cemeteries and family vaults of\\ncreation yielding up the live bodies of all the men women and\\nchildren who were alive seventyfive years ago and adding this\\ncountless host to the present human population of the globe\\n\\nwherefore for all these things we account the whale immortal in his\\nspecies however perishable in his individuality he swam the seas\\nbefore the continents broke water he once swam over the site of the\\ntuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin in noahs flood he\\ndespised noahs ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded like\\nthe netherlands to kill off its rats then the eternal whale will\\nstill survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial\\nflood spout his frothed defiance to the skies\\n\\n\\nchapter 106 ahabs leg\\n\\nthe precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel\\nenderby of london had not been unattended with some small violence to\\nhis own person he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his\\nboat that his ivory leg had received a halfsplintering shock and when\\nafter gaining his own deck and his own pivothole there he so\\nvehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it\\nwas as ever something about his not steering inflexibly enough\\nthen the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and\\nwrench that though it still remained entire and to all appearances\\nlusty yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy\\n\\nand indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all his\\npervading mad recklessness ahab did at times give careful heed to the\\ncondition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood for it had not\\nbeen very long prior to the pequods sailing from nantucket that he\\nhad been found one night lying prone upon the ground and insensible\\nby some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty his\\nivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had stakewise\\nsmitten and all but pierced his groin nor was it without extreme\\ndifficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured\\n\\nnor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind that all\\nthe anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of\\na former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that as the most\\npoisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as\\nthe sweetest songster of the grove so equally with every felicity\\nall miserable events do naturally beget their like yea more than\\nequally thought ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of grief\\ngo further than the ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint of\\nthis that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings that\\nwhile some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them\\nfor the other world but on the contrary shall be followed by the\\njoychildlessness of all hells despair whereas some guilty mortal\\nmiseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally\\nprogressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave not at all to hint of\\nthis there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the\\nthing for thought ahab while even the highest earthly felicities\\never have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at\\nbottom all heartwoes a mystic significance and in some men an\\narchangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracingsout not belie the\\nobvious deduction to trail the genealogies of these high mortal\\nmiseries carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the\\ngods so that in the face of all the glad haymaking suns and soft\\ncymballing round harvestmoons we must needs give in to this that\\nthe gods themselves are not for ever glad the ineffaceable sad\\nbirthmark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sorrow in the\\nsigners\\n\\nunwittingly here a secret has been divulged which perhaps might more\\nproperly in set way have been disclosed before with many other\\nparticulars concerning ahab always had it remained a mystery to some\\nwhy it was that for a certain period both before and after the\\nsailing of the pequod he had hidden himself away with such\\ngrandlamalike exclusiveness and for that one interval sought\\nspeechless refuge as it were among the marble senate of the dead\\ncaptain pelegs bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means\\nadequate though indeed as touching all ahabs deeper part every\\nrevelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory\\nlight but in the end it all came out this one matter did at least\\nthat direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness and\\nnot only this but to that evercontracting dropping circle ashore\\nwho for any reason possessed the privilege of a less banned approach\\nto him to that timid circle the above hinted casualtyremaining as it\\ndid moodily unaccounted for by ahabinvested itself with terrors not\\nentirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails so that\\nthrough their zeal for him they had all conspired so far as in them\\nlay to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others and hence it\\nwas that not till a considerable interval had elapsed did it\\ntranspire upon the pequods decks\\n\\nbut be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air\\nor the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do or not\\nwith earthly ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took\\nplain practical procedureshe called the carpenter\\n\\nand when that functionary appeared before him he bade him without\\ndelay set about making a new leg and directed the mates to see him\\nsupplied with all the studs and joists of jawivory sperm whale which\\nhad thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a careful\\nselection of the stoutest clearestgrained stuff might be secured\\nthis done the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that\\nnight and to provide all the fittings for it independent of those\\npertaining to the distrusted one in use moreover the ships forge was\\nordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold and\\nto accelerate the affair the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at\\nonce to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed\\n\\n\\nchapter 107 the carpenter\\n\\nseat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn and take high\\nabstracted man alone and he seems a wonder a grandeur and a woe but\\nfrom the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they\\nseem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary and hereditary\\nbut most humble though he was and far from furnishing an example of\\nthe high humane abstraction the pequods carpenter was no duplicate\\nhence he now comes in person on this stage\\n\\nlike all seagoing ship carpenters and more especially those belonging\\nto whaling vessels he was to a certain offhanded practical extent\\nalike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his\\nown the carpenters pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk\\nof all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with\\nwood as an auxiliary material but besides the application to him of\\nthe generic remark above this carpenter of the pequod was singularly\\nefficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually\\nrecurring in a large ship upon a three or four years voyage in\\nuncivilized and fardistant seas for not to speak of his readiness in\\nordinary dutiesrepairing stove boats sprung spars reforming the\\nshape of clumsybladed oars inserting bulls eyes in the deck or new\\ntreenails in the side planks and other miscellaneous matters more\\ndirectly pertaining to his special business he was moreover\\nunhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes both\\nuseful and capricious\\n\\nthe one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold\\nwas his vicebench a long rude ponderous table furnished with several\\nvices of different sizes and both of iron and of wood at all times\\nexcept when whales were alongside this bench was securely lashed\\nathwartships against the rear of the tryworks\\n\\na belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole\\nthe carpenter claps it into one of his everready vices and\\nstraightway files it smaller a lost landbird of strange plumage\\nstrays on board and

him be seated there\\nbut the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded\\noperation whirling round the handle of his wooden vice the carpenter\\nsigns him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth\\n\\nthus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indifferent\\nand without respect in all teeth he accounted bits of ivory heads he\\ndeemed but topblocks men themselves he lightly held for capstans but\\nwhile now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with\\nsuch liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue\\nsome uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for\\nnothing was this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal\\nstolidity as it were impersonal i say for it so shaded off into the\\nsurrounding infinite of things that it seemed one with the general\\nstolidity discernible in the whole visible world which while\\npauselessly active in uncounted modes still eternally holds its peace\\nand ignores you though you dig foundations for cathedrals yet was\\nthis halfhorrible stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an\\nallramifying heartlessnessyet was it oddly dashed at times with an\\nold crutchlike antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked\\nnow and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have\\nserved to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded\\nforecastle of noahs ark was it that this old carpenter had been a\\nlifelong wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had\\ngathered no moss but what is more had rubbed off whatever small\\noutward clingings might have originally pertained to him he was a\\nstript abstract an unfractioned integral uncompromised as a newborn\\nbabe living without premeditated reference to this world or the next\\nyou might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him\\ninvolved a sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did\\nnot seem to work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because he\\nhad been tutored to it or by any intermixture of all these even or\\nuneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal\\nprocess he was a pure manipulator his brain if he had ever had one\\nmust have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers he was\\nlike one of those unreasoning but still highly useful _multum in\\nparvo_ sheffield contrivances assuming the exteriorthough a little\\nswelledof a common pocket knife but containing not only blades of\\nvarious sizes but also screwdrivers corkscrews tweezers awls\\npens rulers nailfilers countersinkers so if his superiors wanted\\nto use the carpenter for a screwdriver all they had to do was to open\\nthat part of him and the screw was fast or if for tweezers take him\\nup by the legs and there they were\\n\\nyet as previously hinted this omnitooled openandshut carpenter\\nwas after all no mere machine of an automaton if he did not have a\\ncommon soul in him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously\\ndid its duty what that was whether essence of quicksilver or a few\\ndrops of hartshorn there is no telling but there it was and there it\\nhad abided for now some sixty years or more and this it was this same\\nunaccountable cunning lifeprinciple in him this it was that kept\\nhim a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an\\nunreasoning wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his\\nbody was a sentrybox and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking\\nall the time to keep himself awake\\n\\n\\nchapter 108

cabin to report this unfavourable affair\\n\\nin spermwhalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it\\nis a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and\\ndrench the casks with seawater which afterwards at varying\\nintervals is removed by the ships pumps hereby the casks are sought\\nto be kept damply tight while by the changed character of the\\nwithdrawn water the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the\\nprecious cargo\\n\\nnow from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and\\nthe bashee isles between which lies one of the

eyes nevertheless seemed growing fuller\\nand fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but\\ndeeply looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony\\nto that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened and\\nlike circles on the water which as they grow fainter expand so his\\neyes seemed rounding and rounding like the rings of eternity an awe\\nthat cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of\\nthis waning savage and saw as strange things in his face as any\\nbeheld who were bystanders when zoroaster died for whatever is truly\\nwondrous and fearful in man never yet was put into words or books and\\nthe drawing near of death which alike levels all alike impresses all\\nwith a last revelation which only an author from the dead could\\nadequately tell so thatlet us say it againno dying chaldee or greek\\nhad higher and holier thoughts than those whose mysterious shades you\\nsaw creeping over the face of poor queequeg as he quietly lay in his\\nswaying hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his\\nfinal rest and the oceans invisible floodtide lifted him higher and\\nhigher towards his destined heaven\\n\\nnot a man of the crew but gave him up and as for queequeg himself\\nwhat he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he\\nasked he called one to him in the grey morning watch when the day was\\njust breaking and taking his hand said that while in nantucket he had\\nchanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood like the rich\\nwarwood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learned that all\\nwhalemen who died in nantucket were laid in those same dark canoes\\nand that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him for it was\\nnot unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming a dead\\nwarrior stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to be floated\\naway to the starry archipelagoes for not only do they believe that the\\nstars are isles but that far beyond all visible horizons their own\\nmild uncontinented seas interflow with the blue heavens and so form\\nthe white breakers of the milky way he added that he shuddered at the\\nthought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual\\nseacustom tossed like something vile to the deathdevouring sharks\\nno he desired a canoe like those of nantucket all the more congenial\\nto him being a whaleman that like a whaleboat these coffincanoes\\nwere without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and\\nmuch leeway adown the dim ages\\n\\nnow when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenter\\nwas at once commanded to do queequegs bidding whatever it might\\ninclude there was some heathenish coffincoloured old lumber aboard\\nwhich upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginal\\ngroves of the lackaday islands and from these dark planks the coffin\\nwas recommended to be made no sooner was the carpenter apprised of the\\norder than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indifferent\\npromptitude of his character proceeded into the forecastle and took\\nqueequegs measure with great accuracy regularly chalking queequegs\\nperson as he shifted the rule\\n\\nah poor fellow hell have to die now ejaculated the long island\\nsailor\\n\\ngoing to his vicebench the carpenter for convenience sake and general\\nreference now transferringly measured on it the exact length the\\ncoffin was to be and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two\\nnotches at its extremities this done he marshalled the planks and his\\ntools and to work\\n\\nwhen the last nail was driven and the lid duly planed and fitted he\\nlightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiring\\nwhether they were ready for it yet in that direction\\n\\noverhearing the indignant but halfhumorous cries with which the people\\non deck began to drive the coffin away queequeg to every ones\\nconsternation commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to\\nhim nor was there any denying him seeing that of all mortals some\\ndying men are the most tyrannical and certainly since they will\\nshortly trouble us so little for evermore the poor fellows ought to be\\nindulged\\n\\nleaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coffin with an\\nattentive eye he then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock\\ndrawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along\\nwith one of the paddles of his boat all by his own request also\\nbiscuits were then ranged round the sides within a flask of fresh\\nwater was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up\\nin the hold at the foot and a piece of sailcloth being rolled up for\\na pillow queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed that\\nhe might make trial of its comforts if any it had he lay without\\nmoving a few minutes then told one to go to his bag and bring out his\\nlittle god yojo then crossing his arms on his breast with yojo\\nbetween he called for the coffin lid hatch he called it to be placed\\nover him the head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay\\nqueequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in\\nview rarmai it will do it is easy he murmured at last and\\nsigned to be replaced in his hammock\\n\\nbut ere this was done pip who had been slily hovering near by all\\nthis while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sobbings took\\nhim by the hand in the other holding his tambourine\\n\\npoor rover will

no need of the carpenters box and thereupon when some\\nexpressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the\\ncause of his sudden convalescence was thisat a critical moment he\\nhad just recalled a little duty ashore which he was leaving undone\\nand therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yet\\nhe averred they asked him then whether to live or die was a matter\\nof his own sovereign will and pleasure he answered certainly in a\\nword it was queequegs conceit that if a man made up his mind to\\nlive mere sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale\\nor some violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort\\n\\nnow there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized\\nthat while a sick civilized man may be six months convalescing\\ngenerally speaking a sick savage is almost halfwell again in a day\\nso in good time my queequeg gained strength and at length after\\nsitting on the windlass for a few indolent

hoisted boat and poising a harpoon\\npronounced himself fit for a fight\\n\\nwith a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a seachest and\\nemptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there\\nmany spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner of\\ngrotesque figures and drawings and it seemed that hereby he was\\nstriving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on\\nhis body and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet\\nand seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic marks had written\\nout on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth and a\\nmystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequeg in\\nhis own proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one\\nvolume but whose mysteries not even himself could read though his own\\nlive heart beat against them and these mysteries were therefore\\ndestined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon\\nthey were inscribed

towline was then unwound and some\\nfathoms of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension\\npressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harpstring\\nthen eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings ahab exclaimed\\ngood and now for the seizings\\n\\nat one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spread yarns\\nwere all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole\\nwas then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope\\nwas traced halfway along the poles length and firmly secured so\\nwith intertwistings of twine this done pole iron and ropelike the\\nthree fatesremained inseparable and ahab moodily stalked away with\\nthe weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory\\npole both hollowly ringing along every plank but ere he entered his\\ncabin light unnatural halfbantering yet most piteous sound was\\nheard oh pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy\\nstrange mummeries not

bolted down her bursting hatches and now in\\nglad holiday apparel was joyously though somewhat vaingloriously\\nsailing round among the widelyseparated ships on the ground previous\\nto pointing her prow for home\\n\\nthe three men at her masthead wore long streamers of narrow red\\nbunting at their hats from the stern a whaleboat was suspended\\nbottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long\\nlower jaw of the last whale they had slain signals ensigns and jacks\\nof all colours were flying from her rigging on every side sideways\\nlashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm\\nabove which in her topmast crosstrees you saw slender breakers of\\nthe same precious fluid and nailed to her main truck was a brazen\\nlamp\\n\\nas was afterwards learned the bachelor had met with the most\\nsurprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in\\nthe same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without\\nsecuring a single fish not only had barrels of beef and bread been\\ngiven away to make room for the far more valuable sperm but additional\\nsupplemental casks had been bartered for from the ships she had met\\nand these were stowed along the deck and in the captains and\\nofficers staterooms even the cabin table itself had been knocked\\ninto kindlingwood and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an\\noilbutt lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece in the\\nforecastle the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests\\nand filled them it was humorously added that the cook had clapped a\\nhead on his largest boiler and filled it that the steward had plugged\\nhis spare coffeepot and filled it that the harpooneers had headed the\\nsockets of their irons and filled them that indeed everything was\\nfilled with sperm except the captains pantaloons pockets and those\\nhe reserved to thrust his hands into in selfcomplacent testimony of\\nhis entire satisfaction\\n\\nas this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod the\\nbarbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawing\\nstill nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge\\ntrypots which covered with the parchmentlike _poke_ or stomach skin\\nof the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the\\nclenched hands of the crew on the quarterdeck the mates and\\nharpooneers were dancing with the olivehued girls who had eloped with\\nthem from the polynesian isles while suspended in an ornamented boat\\nfirmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast three long\\nisland negroes with glittering fiddlebows of whale ivory were\\npresiding over the hilarious jig meanwhile others of the ships\\ncompany were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the tryworks from\\nwhich the huge pots had been removed you would have almost thought\\nthey were pulling down the cursed bastille such wild cries they\\nraised as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the\\nsea\\n\\nlord and master over all this scene the captain stood erect on the\\nships elevated quarterdeck so that the whole rejoicing drama was\\nfull before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individual\\ndiversion\\n\\nand ahab he too was standing on his quarterdeck shaggy and black\\nwith a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each others\\nwakesone all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodings\\nas to things to cometheir two captains in themselves impersonated the\\nwhole striking contrast of the scene\\n\\ncome aboard come aboard cried the gay bachelors commander lifting\\na glass and a bottle in the air\\n\\nhast seen the white whale gritted ahab in reply\\n\\nno only heard of him but dont believe in him at all said

thou sayst well then call me an\\nempty ship and outwardbound so go thy ways and i will mine forward\\nthere set all sail and keep her to the wind\\n\\nand thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other\\nstubbornly fought against it and so the two vessels parted the crew\\nof the pequod looking with grave lingering glances towards the\\nreceding bachelor but the bachelors men never heeding their gaze for\\nthe lively revelry they were in and as ahab leaning over the\\ntaffrail eyed the homewardbound craft he took from his pocket a\\nsmall vial of sand and then looking from

and\\nthe lantern hanging from its top cast a troubled flickering glare upon\\nthe black glossy back and far out upon the midnight waves which\\ngently chafed the whales broad flank like soft surf upon a beach\\n\\nahab and all his boats crew seemed asleep but the parsee who\\ncrouching in the bow sat watching the sharks that spectrally played\\nround the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails a\\nsound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven\\nghosts of gomorrah ran shuddering through the air\\n\\nstarted from his slumbers ahab face to face saw the

drew near and every day when ahab\\ncoming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman would\\nostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager mariners quickly run to\\nthe braces and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed\\non the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ships\\nprow for the equator in good time the order came it was hard upon\\nhigh noon and ahab seated in the bows of his highhoisted boat was\\nabout taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his\\nlatitude\\n\\nnow in that japanese sea the days in summer are as freshets of\\neffulgences that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing\\nfocus of the glassy oceans immeasurable burningglass the sky looks\\nlacquered clouds there are none the horizon floats and this\\nnakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of\\ngods throne well that ahabs quadrant was furnished with coloured\\nglasses through which to take sight of that solar fire so swinging\\nhis seated form to the roll of the ship and with his\\nastrologicallooking instrument placed to his eye he remained in that\\nposture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun\\nshould gain its precise meridian meantime while his whole attention\\nwas absorbed the parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ships deck\\nand with face thrown up like ahabs was eyeing the same sun with him\\nonly the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs and his wild face was\\nsubdued to an earthly passionlessness at length the desired\\nobservation was taken and with his pencil upon his ivory leg ahab\\nsoon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant then\\nfalling into a moments revery he again looked up towards the sun and\\nmurmured to himself thou seamark thou high and mighty pilot thou\\ntellest me truly where i _am_but canst thou cast the least hint where\\ni _shall_ be or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is\\nthis

beholding\\nthe objects on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun\\n\\nthen gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other its\\nnumerous cabalistical contrivances he pondered again and muttered\\nfoolish toy babies plaything of haughty admirals and commodores\\nand captains the world brags of thee of thy cunning and might but\\nwhat after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point where\\nthou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet and the hand that\\nholds thee no not one jot more thou canst not tell where one drop of\\nwater or one grain of sand will be tomorrow

same\\ninstant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead\\n\\nwhos there\\n\\nold thunder said ahab groping his way along the bulwarks to his\\npivothole but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed\\nlances of fire\\n\\nnow as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off\\nthe perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some\\nships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water but\\nas this conductor must descend to considerable depth that its end may\\navoid all contact with the hull and as moreover if kept constantly\\ntowing there it would be liable to many mishaps besides interfering\\nnot a little with some of the rigging and more or less impeding the\\nvessels way in the water because of all this the lower parts of a\\nships lightningrods are not always overboard but are generally made\\nin long slender links so as to be the more readily hauled up into the\\nchains outside or thrown down into the sea as occasion may require\\n\\nthe rods the rods cried starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished\\nto vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting\\nflambeaux to light ahab to his post are they overboard drop them\\nover fore and aft quick\\n\\navast cried ahab lets have fair play here though we be the\\nweaker side yet ill contribute to raise rods on the himmalehs and\\nandes that all the world may be secured but out on privileges let\\nthem be sir\\n\\nlook aloft cried starbuck the corpusants the corpusants\\n\\nall the yardarms were tipped with a pallid fire and touched at each\\ntripointed lightningrodend with three tapering white flames each of\\nthe three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air like\\nthree gigantic wax tapers before an altar\\n\\nblast the boat let it go cried stubb at this instant as a swashing\\nsea heaved up under his own little craft so that its gunwale violently\\njammed his hand as he was passing a lashing blast itbut slipping\\nbackward on the deck his uplifted eyes caught the flames and\\nimmediately shifting his tone he criedthe corpusants have mercy on us\\nall\\n\\nto sailors oaths are household words they will swear in the trance of\\nthe calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate curses\\nfrom the topsailyardarms when most they teeter over to a seething\\nsea but in all my voyagings seldom have i heard a common oath when\\ngods burning finger has been laid on the ship when his mene mene\\ntekel upharsin has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage\\n\\nwhile this pallidness was burning aloft few words were heard from the\\nenchanted crew who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle all\\ntheir eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence like a far away\\nconstellation of stars relieved against the ghostly light the\\ngigantic jet negro daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and\\nseemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come the parted\\nmouth of tashtego revealed his sharkwhite teeth which strangely\\ngleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by\\nthe preternatural light queequegs tattooing burned like satanic blue\\nflames on his body\\n\\nthe tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and once more\\nthe pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall a moment\\nor two passed when starbuck going forward pushed against some one\\nit was stubb what thinkest thou now man i heard thy cry it was not\\nthe same in the song\\n\\nno no it wasnt i said the corpusants have mercy on us all and i\\nhope they will still but do they only have mercy on long faceshave\\nthey no bowels for a laugh and look ye mr starbuckbut its too dark\\nto look hear me then i take that masthead flame we saw for a sign\\nof good luck for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be\\nchock a block with spermoil dye see and so all that sperm will\\nwork up into the masts like sap in a tree yes our three masts will\\nyet be as three spermaceti candlesthats the good promise we saw\\n\\nat that moment starbuck caught sight of stubbs face slowly beginning\\nto glimmer into sight glancing upwards he cried see see and once\\nmore the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled\\nsupernaturalness in their pallor\\n\\nthe corpusants have mercy on us all cried stubb again\\n\\nat the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the flame\\nthe parsee was kneeling in ahabs front but with his head bowed away\\nfrom him while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where\\nthey had just been engaged securing a spar a number of the seamen\\narrested by the glare now cohered together and hung pendulous like a\\nknot of numbed wasps from a drooping orchard twig in various\\nenchanted attitudes like the standing or stepping or running\\nskeletons in herculaneum others remained rooted to the deck but all\\ntheir eyes upcast\\n\\naye aye men cried ahab look up at it mark it well the white\\nflame but lights the way to the white whale hand me those mainmast\\nlinks there i would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against\\nit blood against fire so\\n\\nthen turningthe last link held fast in his left hand he put his foot\\nupon the parsee and with fixed upward eye and highflung right arm\\nhe stood erect before the lofty tripointed trinity of flames\\n\\noh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these seas i as persian\\nonce did worship till in the sacramental act so burned by thee that\\nto this

mutinous cry but\\ndashing the rattling lightning links to the deck and snatching the\\nburning harpoon ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to\\ntransfix with it the first sailor that but

giants palms outspread the strong unstaggering breeze abounded\\nso that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails the whole world\\nboomed before the wind muffled in the full morning light the\\ninvisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place\\nwhere his bayonet rays moved on in stacks emblazonings as of crowned\\nbabylonian kings and queens reigned over everything the sea was as a\\ncrucible of molten gold that bubblingly leaps with light and heat\\n\\nlong maintaining an enchanted silence ahab stood apart and every time\\nthe tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to\\neye the bright suns rays produced ahead and when she profoundly\\nsettled by the stern he turned behind and saw the suns rearward\\nplace and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating\\nwake\\n\\nha ha my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the seachariot\\nof the sun ho ho all ye nations before my prow i bring the sun to\\nye yoke on the further billows hallo a tandem i drive the sea\\n\\nbut suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towards\\nthe helm huskily demanding how the ship was heading\\n\\neastsoueast sir said the frightened steersman\\n\\nthou liest smiting him with his clenched fist heading east at this\\nhour in the morning and the sun astern\\n\\nupon this every soul was confounded for the phenomenon just then\\nobserved by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but its very\\nblinding palpableness must have been the cause\\n\\nthrusting his head half way into the binnacle ahab caught one glimpse\\nof the compasses his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost\\nseemed to stagger standing behind him starbuck looked and lo the two\\ncompasses pointed east and the pequod was as infallibly going west\\n\\nbut ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the\\nold man with a rigid laugh exclaimed i have it it has happened\\nbefore mr starbuck last nights thunder turned our compassesthats\\nall thou hast before now heard of such a thing i take it\\n\\naye but never before has it happened to me sir said the pale mate\\ngloomily\\n\\nhere it must needs be said that accidents like this have in more than\\none case occurred to ships in violent storms the magnetic energy as\\ndeveloped in the mariners needle is as all know essentially one\\nwith the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much\\nmarvelled at that such things should be instances where the lightning\\nhas actually struck the vessel so as to smite down some of the spars\\nand rigging the effect upon the needle has at times been still more\\nfatal all its loadstone virtue being annihilated so that the before\\nmagnetic steel was of no more use than an old wifes knitting needle\\nbut in either case the needle never again of itself recovers the\\noriginal virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compasses be\\naffected the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship\\neven were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson\\n\\ndeliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed\\ncompasses the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took\\nthe precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needles were\\nexactly inverted shouted out his orders for the ships course to be\\nchanged accordingly the yards were hard up and once more the pequod\\nthrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind for the supposed fair\\none had only been juggling her\\n\\nmeanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts starbuck said\\nnothing but quietly he issued all requisite orders while stubb and\\nflaskwho in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his\\nfeelingslikewise unmurmuringly acquiesced as for the men though some\\nof them lowly rumbled their fear of ahab was greater than their fear\\nof fate but as ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almost\\nwholly unimpressed or if impressed it was only with a certain\\nmagnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible ahabs\\n\\nfor a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries but\\nchancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed copper\\nsighttubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck\\n\\nthou poor proud heavengazer and suns pilot yesterday i wrecked\\nthee and today the compasses would fain have wrecked me so so but\\nahab is lord over the level loadstone yet mr starbucka lance without\\na pole a topmaul and the smallest of the sailmakers needles\\nquick\\n\\naccessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about\\nto do were certain prudential motives whose object might have been to\\nrevive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a\\nmatter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses besides the old\\nman well knew that to steer by transpointed needles though clumsily\\npracticable was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious\\nsailors without some shudderings and evil portents\\n\\nmen said he steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handed him\\nthe things he had demanded my men the thunder turned old ahabs\\nneedles but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own\\nthat will point as true as any\\n\\nabashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors as\\nthis was said and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic\\nmight follow but starbuck looked away\\n\\nwith a blow from the topmaul ahab knocked off the steel head of the\\nlance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade\\nhim hold it upright without its touching the deck then with the\\nmaul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod he\\nplaced the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly\\nhammered that several times the mate still holding the rod as before\\nthen going through some small strange motions with itwhether\\nindispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to\\naugment the awe of the crew is uncertainhe called for linen thread\\nand moving to the binnacle slipped out the two reversed needles there\\nand horizontally suspended the sailneedle by its middle over one of\\nthe compasscards at first the steel went round and round quivering\\nand vibrating at either end but at last it settled to its place when\\nahab who had been intently watching for this result stepped frankly\\nback from the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it\\nexclaimedlook ye for yourselves if ahab be not lord of the level\\nloadstone the sun is east and that compass swears it\\n\\none after another they peered in for nothing but their own eyes could\\npersuade such ignorance as theirs and one after another they slunk\\naway\\n\\nin his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph you then saw ahab in all his\\nfatal pride\\n\\n\\nchapter 125 the log and line\\n\\nwhile now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the log\\nand line had but very seldom been in use owing to a confident reliance\\nupon other means of determining the vessels place some merchantmen\\nand many whalemen especially when cruising wholly neglect to heave\\nthe log though at the same time and frequently more for forms sake\\nthan anything else regularly putting down upon the customary slate the\\ncourse steered by the ship as well as the presumed average rate of\\nprogression every hour it had been thus with the pequod the wooden\\nreel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath the\\nrailing of the after bulwarks rains and spray had damped it sun and\\nwind had warped it all the elements had combined to rot a thing that\\nhung so idly but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab as he\\nhappened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnet\\nscene and he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalled his\\nfrantic oath about the level log and line the ship was sailing\\nplungingly astern the billows rolled in riots\\n\\nforward there heave the log\\n\\ntwo seamen came the goldenhued tahitian and the grizzly manxman\\ntake the reel one of ye ill

took the reel and holding it high up by the projecting\\nhandleends of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so\\nstood with the angular log hanging downwards till ahab advanced to\\nhim\\n\\nahab stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty\\nturns to form a preliminary handcoil to toss overboard when the old\\nmanxman who was intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to\\nspeak\\n\\nsir i mistrust it this line looks far gone long heat and wet have\\nspoiled it\\n\\ntwill hold old gentleman long heat and wet have they spoiled thee\\nthou seemst

straightened out in a long\\ndragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl in\\nturn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows the towing\\nresistance of the log caused the

determined by ahabs level log and line the pequod held on her\\npath towards the equator making so long a passage through such\\nunfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sideways\\nimpelled by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonously mild all\\nthese seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and\\ndesperate scene\\n\\nat last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it were of the\\nequatorial fishingground and in the deep darkness that goes before\\nthe dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the watchthen\\nheaded by flaskwas startled by a cry so plaintively wild and\\nunearthlylike halfarticulated wailings of the ghosts of all herods\\nmurdered innocentsthat one and all they started from their reveries\\nand for the space of some moments stood or sat or leaned all\\ntransfixedly listening like the carved roman slave while that wild\\ncry remained within hearing the christian or civilized part of the\\ncrew said it was mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneers\\nremained unappalled yet the grey manxmanthe oldest mariner of\\nalldeclared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the\\nvoices of newly drowned men in the sea\\n\\nbelow in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he\\ncame to the deck it was then recounted to him by flask not\\nunaccompanied with hinted dark meanings he hollowly laughed and thus\\nexplained the wonder\\n\\nthose rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great\\nnumbers of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or\\nsome dams that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and\\nkept company with her crying and sobbing with their human sort of\\nwail but this only the more affected some of them because most\\nmariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals arising not\\nonly from their peculiar tones when in distress but also from the\\nhuman look of their round heads and semiintelligent faces seen\\npeeringly uprising from the water alongside in the sea under certain\\ncircumstances seals have more than once been mistaken for men\\n\\nbut the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible\\nconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning at\\nsunrise this man went from his hammock to his masthead at the fore\\nand whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for\\nsailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it was thus\\nwith the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he had\\nnot been long at his perch when a cry was hearda cry and a\\nrushingand looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and\\nlooking down a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the\\nsea\\n\\nthe lifebuoya long slender caskwas dropped from the stern where it\\nalways hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize it\\nand the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that it\\nslowly filled and that parched wood also filled at its every pore and\\nthe studded ironbound cask followed the sailor to the bottom as if to\\nyield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one\\n\\nand thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out\\nfor the white whale on the white whales own peculiar ground that man\\nwas swallowed up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the\\ntime indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at\\nleast as a portent for they regarded it not as a foreshadowing of\\nevil in the future but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged\\nthey declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they\\nhad heard the night before but again the old manxman said nay\\n\\nthe lost lifebuoy was now to be replaced starbuck was directed to see\\nto it but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and as in\\nthe feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the\\nvoyage all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly\\nconnected with its final end whatever that might prove to be\\ntherefore they were going to leave the ships stern unprovided with a\\nbuoy when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a\\nhint concerning his coffin\\n\\na lifebuoy of a coffin cried starbuck starting\\n\\nrather queer that i should say said stubb\\n\\nit will make a good enough one said flask the carpenter here can\\narrange it easily\\n\\nbring it up theres nothing else for it said starbuck after a\\nmelancholy pause rig it carpenter do not look at me sothe coffin\\ni mean dost thou hear me rig it\\n\\nand shall i nail down the lid sir moving his hand as with a hammer\\n\\naye\\n\\nand shall i caulk the seams sir moving his hand as with

time\\nthe pequod was making good speed through the water but as the\\nbroadwinged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sails all\\nfell together as blank bladders that are burst and all life fled from\\nthe smitten hull\\n\\nbad news she brings bad news muttered the old manxman but ere her\\ncommander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he\\ncould hopefully hail ahabs voice was heard\\n\\nhast seen the white whale\\n\\naye yesterday have ye seen a whaleboat adrift\\n\\nthrottling his joy ahab negatively answered this unexpected question\\nand would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger\\ncaptain himself having stopped his vessels way was seen descending\\nher side a few keen pulls and his boathook soon clinched the\\npequods mainchains and he sprang to the deck immediately he was\\nrecognised by ahab for a nantucketer he knew but no formal salutation\\nwas exchanged\\n\\nwhere was henot killednot killed cried ahab closely advancing\\nhow was it\\n\\nit seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous\\nwhile three of the strangers boats were engaged with a shoal of\\nwhales which had led them some four or five miles from the ship and\\nwhile they were yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head\\nof moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water not very far to\\nleeward whereupon the fourth rigged boata reserved onehad been\\ninstantly lowered in chase after a keen sail before the wind this\\nfourth boatthe swiftest keeled of allseemed to have succeeded in\\nfasteningat least as well as the man at the masthead could tell\\nanything about it in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat\\nand then a swift gleam of bubbling white water and after that nothing\\nmore whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have\\nindefinitely run away with his pursuers as often happens there was\\nsome apprehension but no positive alarm as yet the recall signals\\nwere placed in the rigging darkness came on and forced to pick up her\\nthree far to windward boatsere going in quest of the fourth one in the\\nprecisely opposite directionthe ship had not only been necessitated to\\nleave that boat to its fate till near midnight but for the time to\\nincrease her distance from it but the rest of her crew being at last\\nsafe aboard she crowded all sailstunsail on stunsailafter the\\nmissing boat kindling a fire in her trypots for a beacon and every\\nother man aloft on the lookout but though when she had thus sailed a\\nsufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when\\nlast seen though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all\\naround her and not finding anything had again dashed on again\\npaused and lowered her boats and though she had thus continued doing\\ntill daylight yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been\\nseen\\n\\nthe story told the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his\\nobject in boarding the pequod he desired that ship to unite with his\\nown in the search by sailing over the sea some four or five miles\\napart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon as it were\\n\\ni will wager something now whispered stubb to flask that some one\\nin that missing boat wore off that captains best coat mayhap his\\nwatchhes so cursed anxious to get it back who ever heard of two\\npious whaleships cruising after one missing whaleboat in the height\\nof the whaling season see flask only see how pale he lookspale in\\nthe very buttons of his eyeslookit wasnt the coatit must have been\\nthe\\n\\nmy boy my own boy is among them for gods sakei beg i\\nconjurehere exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab who thus far had\\nbut icily received his petition for eightandforty hours let

cried stubb oh its his son hes lost i take back the\\ncoat and watchwhat says ahab we must save that boy\\n\\nhes drowned with the rest on em last night said the old manx\\nsailor standing behind them i heard all of ye heard their spirits\\n\\nnow as it shortly turned out what made this incident of the rachels\\nthe more melancholy was the circumstance that not only was one of the\\ncaptains sons among the number of the missing boats crew but among\\nthe number of the other boats crews at the same time but on the\\nother hand separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the\\nchase there had been still another son as that for a time the\\nwretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity\\nwhich was only solved for him by his chief mates

darkly\\ngrew all gnarled as unearthed roots of trees blown over which still\\ngrow idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure but\\nthough his whole life was now become one watch on

his basket prepared a pin\\nfor the other end in order to fasten it at the rail this done with\\nthat end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round\\nupon his crew sweeping from one

height\\n\\nwhen in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in\\nthe rigging which chances to afford no foothold the sailor at sea is\\nhoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these\\ncircumstances its fastened end on deck is always given in strict\\ncharge to some one man who has the special watch of it because in such\\na wilderness of running rigging whose various different relations\\naloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at\\nthe deck and when the deckends of these ropes are being every few\\nminutes cast down from the fastenings it would be but a natural\\nfatality if unprovided with a constant watchman the hoisted sailor\\nshould by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all\\nswooping to the sea so ahabs proceedings in this matter were not\\nunusual the only strange thing about them seemed to be that starbuck\\nalmost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with\\nanything in the slightest degree approaching to decisionone of those\\ntoo whose faithfulness on the lookout he had seemed to doubt\\nsomewhatit was strange that this was the very man he should select\\nfor his

seahawks which so often fly\\nincommodiously close round the manned mastheads of whalemen in these\\nlatitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\\nhead in a maze of untrackably swift circlings then it darted a\\nthousand feet straight up into the air then spiralized downwards and\\nwent eddying again round his head\\n\\nbut with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed\\nnot to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked\\nit much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least\\nheedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every\\nsight\\n\\nyour hat your hat sir suddenly cried the sicilian seaman who\\nbeing posted at the mizenmasthead stood directly behind ahab though\\nsomewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing\\nthem\\n\\nbut already the sable wing was before the old mans eyes the long\\nhooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk darted away with\\nhis prize\\n\\nan eagle flew thrice round tarquins head removing his cap to replace\\nit and thereupon tanaquil his wife declared that tarquin would be\\nking of rome but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen\\naccounted good ahabs hat was never restored the wild hawk flew on\\nand on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared\\nwhile from the point of that

his entire dazzling\\nhump was distinctly visible sliding along the sea as if an isolated\\nthing and continually set in a revolving ring of finest fleecy\\ngreenish foam he saw the vast involved wrinkles of the slightly\\nprojecting head beyond before it far out on the soft turkishrugged\\nwaters went the glistening white shadow from his broad milky\\nforehead a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade and\\nbehind the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving\\nvalley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bubbles arose and\\ndanced by his side but these were broken again by the light toes of\\nhundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea alternate with their\\nfitful flight and like to some flagstaff rising from the painted hull\\nof an argosy the

himself sounded and went out of sight\\nhoveringly halting and dipping on the wing the white seafowls\\nlongingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left\\n\\nwith oars apeak and paddles down the sheets of their sails adrift\\nthe three boats now stilly floated awaiting moby dicks reappearance\\n\\nan hour said ahab standing rooted in his boats stern and he gazed\\nbeyond the whales place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing\\nvacancies to leeward it was only an instant for again his eyes seemed\\nwhirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle the breeze\\nnow freshened the sea began to swell\\n\\nthe birdsthe birds cried tashtego\\n\\nin long indian file as when herons take wing the white birds were now\\nall flying towards ahabs boat and when within a few yards began\\nfluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous\\nexpectant cries their vision was keener than mans ahab could\\ndiscover no sign in the sea but suddenly as he peered down and down\\ninto its depths he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a\\nwhite weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as it\\nrose till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long\\ncrooked rows of white glistening teeth floating up from the\\nundiscoverable bottom it was moby dicks open mouth and scrolled jaw\\nhis vast shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea\\nthe glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an opendoored marble\\ntomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar ahab whirled\\nthe craft aside from this tremendous apparition then calling upon\\nfedallah to change places with him went forward to the bows and\\nseizing perths harpoon commanded his crew to grasp their oars and\\nstand by to stern\\n\\nnow by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis\\nits bow by anticipation was made to face the whales head while yet\\nunder water but as if perceiving this stratagem moby dick with that\\nmalicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted\\nhimself as it were in an instant shooting his pleated head\\nlengthwise beneath the boat\\n\\nthrough and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for\\nan instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of a\\nbiting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\\nmouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into\\nthe open air and one of the teeth caught in a rowlock the bluish\\npearlwhite of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahabs\\nhead and reached higher than that in this attitude the white whale\\nnow shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse with\\nunastonished eyes fedallah gazed and crossed his arms but the\\ntigeryellow crew were tumbling over each others heads to gain the\\nuttermost stern\\n\\nand now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out as the\\nwhale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his\\nbody being submerged beneath the boat he could not be darted at from\\nthe bows for the bows were almost inside of him as it were and while\\nthe other boats involuntarily paused as before a quick crisis\\nimpossible to withstand then it was that monomaniac ahab furious with\\nthis tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and\\nhelpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied with all this he seized\\nthe long bone with his naked hands and wildly strove to wrench it from\\nits gripe as now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the\\nfrail gunwales bent in collapsed and snapped as both jaws like an\\nenormous shears sliding further aft bit the craft completely in\\ntwain and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the\\ntwo floating wrecks these floated aside the broken ends drooping the\\ncrew at the sternwreck clinging to the gunwales and striving to hold\\nfast to the oars to lash them across\\n\\nat that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped ahab the first\\nto perceive the whales intent by the crafty upraising of his head a\\nmovement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand had\\nmade one final effort to push the boat out of the bite but only\\nslipping further into the whales mouth and tilting over sideways as\\nit slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled him\\nout of it as he leaned to the push and so he fell flatfaced upon the\\nsea\\n\\nripplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now lay at a little\\ndistance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\\nbillows and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body\\nso that when his vast wrinkled forehead rosesome twenty or more feet\\nout of the waterthe now rising swells with all their confluent waves\\ndazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossing their shivered spray\\nstill higher into the air so in a gale the but half baffled channel\\nbillows only recoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to\\noverleap its summit with their scud\\n\\nthis motion is peculiar to the sperm whale it receives its\\ndesignation pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminary\\nupanddown poise of the whalelance in the exercise called\\npitchpoling previously described by this motion the whale must best\\nand most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him\\n\\nbut soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick swam swiftly round\\nand round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengeful\\nwake as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly\\nassault the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him as the\\nblood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochuss elephants in the\\nbook of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the\\nwhales insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swimthough he\\ncould still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that\\nhelpless ahabs head was seen like a tossed bubble which the least\\nchance shock might burst from the boats fragmentary stern fedallah\\nincuriously and mildly eyed him the clinging crew at the other\\ndrifting end could not succor him more than enough was it for them to\\nlook to themselves for so revolvingly appalling was the white whales\\naspect and so planetarily swift the evercontracting circles he made\\nthat he seemed horizontally swooping upon them and though the other\\nboats unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into\\nthe eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instant\\ndestruction of the jeopardized castaways ahab and all nor in that\\ncase could they themselves hope to escape with straining eyes then\\nthey remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre had\\nnow become the old mans head\\n\\nmeantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the ships\\nmast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down upon the scene\\nand was now so nigh that ahab in the water hailed hersail on\\nthebut that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick and\\nwhelmed him for the time but struggling out of it again and chancing\\nto rise on a towering crest he shoutedsail on the whaledrive him\\noff\\n\\nthe pequods prows were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle\\nshe effectually parted the white whale from his victim as he sullenly\\nswam off the boats flew to the rescue\\n\\ndragged into stubbs boat with bloodshot blinded eyes the white\\nbrine caking in his wrinkles the long tension of ahabs bodily\\nstrength did crack and helplessly he yielded to his bodys doom for a\\ntime lying all crushed in the bottom of stubbs boat like one trodden\\nunder foot of herds of elephants far inland nameless wails came from\\nhim as desolate sounds from out ravines\\n\\nbut this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\\nabbreviate it in an instants compass great hearts sometimes condense\\nto one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused\\nthrough feebler mens whole lives and so such hearts though summary\\nin each one suffering still if the gods decree it in their lifetime\\naggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous\\nintensities for even in their pointless centres those noble natures\\ncontain the entire circumferences of inferior souls\\n\\nthe harpoon said ahab half way rising and draggingly leaning on\\none bended armis it safe\\n\\naye sir for it was not darted this is

stove its crew being picked\\nup by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase is\\nthus continued with what is called doublebanked oars it was thus now\\nbut the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the\\nwhale for he seemed to have treblebanked his every fin swimming with\\na velocity which plainly showed that if now under these\\ncircumstances pushed on the chase would prove an indefinitely\\nprolonged if not a hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long\\na period such an unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing\\nbarely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude the ship itself\\nthen as it sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediate\\nmeans of overtaking the chase accordingly the boats now made for her\\nand were soon swayed up to their cranesthe two parts of the wrecked\\nboat having been previously secured by herand then hoisting everything\\nto her side and stacking her canvas high up and sideways\\noutstretching it with stunsails like the doublejointed wings of an\\nalbatross the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of mobydick at\\nthe well known methodic intervals the whales glittering spout was\\nregularly announced from the manned mastheads and when he would be\\nreported as just gone down ahab would take the time and then pacing\\nthe deck binnaclewatch in hand so soon as the last second of the\\nallotted hour expired his voice was heardwhose is the doubloon now\\ndye see him and if the reply was no sir straightway he commanded\\nthem to lift him to his perch in

still higher or to spread one to a\\nstill greater breadththus to and fro pacing beneath his slouched hat\\nat every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped\\nupon the quarterdeck and lay there reversed broken bow to shattered\\nstern at last he paused before it and as in an already overclouded\\nsky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across so over the old\\nmans face there now stole some such added gloom as this\\n\\nstubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though to\\nevince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in\\nhis captains mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimedthe\\nthistle the ass refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha\\n\\nwhat soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck man man did\\ni not

thought\\nforthe topgallant sailsaye they should have been kept on her all\\nnight but no mattertis but resting for the rush\\n\\nhere be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular\\nwhale continued through day into night and through night into day is\\na thing by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery for such is\\nthe wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible\\nconfidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket\\ncommanders that from the simple observation of a whale when last\\ndescried they will under certain given circumstances pretty\\naccurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to\\nswim for a time while out of sight as well as his probable rate of\\nprogression during that period and in these cases somewhat as a\\npilot when about losing sight of a coast whose general trending he\\nwell knows and which he desires shortly to return to again but at\\nsome further point like as this pilot stands by his compass and takes\\nthe precise bearing of the cape at present visible in order the more\\ncertainly to hit aright the remote unseen headland eventually to be\\nvisited so does the fisherman at his compass with the whale for\\nafter being chased and diligently marked through several hours of\\ndaylight then when night obscures the fish the creatures future\\nwake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious\\nmind of the hunter as the pilots coast is to him so that to this\\nhunters wondrous skill the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in\\nwater a wake is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the\\nsteadfast land and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway\\nis so familiarly known in its every pace that with watches in their\\nhands men time his rate as doctors that of a babys pulse and lightly\\nsay of it the up train or the down train will reach such or such a\\nspot at such or such an hour even so almost there are occasions\\nwhen these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep\\naccording to the observed humor of his speed and say to themselves so\\nmany hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles will have\\nabout reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude but to\\nrender this acuteness at all successful in the end the wind and the\\nsea must be the whalemans allies for of what present avail to the\\nbecalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is\\nexactly ninetythree leagues and a quarter from his port inferable\\nfrom these statements are many collateral subtile matters touching the\\nchase of whales\\n\\nthe ship tore on leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a\\ncannonball missent becomes a ploughshare and turns up

anew whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might\\nhave felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the\\ngrowing awe of ahab but they were broken up and on all sides routed\\nas timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison the hand\\nof fate had snatched all their souls and by the stirring perils of the\\nprevious day the rack of the past nights suspense the fixed\\nunfearing blind reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging\\ntowards its flying mark by all these things their hearts were bowled\\nalong the wind that made great bellies of their sails and rushed the\\nvessel on by arms invisible as irresistible this seemed the symbol of\\nthat unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race\\n\\nthey were one man not thirty for as the one ship that held them all\\nthough it was put together of all contrasting thingsoak and maple\\nand pine wood iron and pitch and hempyet all these ran into each\\nother in the one concrete hull which shot on its way both balanced\\nand directed by the long central keel even so all the individualities\\nof the crew this mans valor that mans fear guilt and guiltiness\\nall varieties were welded into oneness and were all directed to that\\nfatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to\\n\\nthe rigging lived the mastheads like the tops of tall palms were\\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs clinging to a spar with one\\nhand some reached forth the other with impatient wavings others\\nshading their eyes from the vivid sunlight sat far out on the rocking\\nyards all the spars in full bearing of mortals ready and ripe for\\ntheir fate ah how they still strove through that infinite blueness to\\nseek out the thing that might destroy them\\n\\nwhy sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried ahab when after\\nthe lapse of some minutes since the first cry no more had been heard\\nsway me up men ye have been deceived not moby dick casts one odd\\njet that way and then disappears\\n\\nit was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some\\nother thing for the whalespout as the event itself soon proved for\\nhardly had ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to its\\npin on deck when he struck the keynote to an orchestra that made the\\nair vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles the triumphant\\nhalloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard asmuch nearer to the ship\\nthan the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile aheadmoby dick\\nbodily burst into view for not by any calm and indolent spoutings not\\nby the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the\\nwhite whale now reveal his vicinity but by the far more wondrous\\nphenomenon of breaching rising with his utmost velocity from the\\nfurthest depths the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the\\npure element of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam shows\\nhis place to the distance of seven miles and more in those moments\\nthe torn enraged waves he shakes off seem his mane in some cases\\nthis breaching is his act of defiance\\n\\nthere she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in his\\nimmeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmonlike to\\nheaven so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relieved\\nagainst the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raised\\nfor the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier and\\nstood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\\nintensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale\\n\\naye breach your last to the sun moby dick cried ahab thy hour\\nand thy harpoon are at handdown down all of ye but one man at the\\nfore the boatsstand

cheering his men he told\\nthem he would take the whale headandheadthat is pull straight up\\nto his foreheada not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit\\nsuch a course excludes the coming onset from the whales sidelong\\nvision but ere that close limit was gained and while yet all three\\nboats were plain as the ships three masts to his eye the white whale\\nchurning himself into furious speed almost in an instant as it were\\nrushing among the boats with open jaws and a lashing tail offered\\nappalling battle on every side and heedless of the irons darted at him\\nfrom every boat seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank\\nof which those boats were made but skilfully manœuvred incessantly\\nwheeling like trained chargers in the field the boats for a while\\neluded him though at times but by a planks breadth while all the\\ntime ahabs unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds\\n\\nbut at last in his untraceable evolutions the white whale so crossed\\nand recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three\\nlines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves\\nwarped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him though now\\nfor a moment the whale drew aside a little as if to rally for a more\\ntremendous charge seizing that opportunity ahab first paid out more\\nline and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it againhoping\\nthat way to disencumber it of some snarlswhen loa sight more savage\\nthan the embattled teeth of sharks\\n\\ncaught and twistedcorkscrewed in the mazes of the line loose harpoons\\nand lances with all their bristling barbs and points came flashing\\nand dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahabs boat only one\\nthing could be done seizing the boatknife he critically reached\\nwithinthroughand then withoutthe rays of steel dragged in the line\\nbeyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice sundering\\nthe rope near the chocksdropped the intercepted fagot of steel into\\nthe sea and was all fast again that instant the white whale made a\\nsudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines by so\\ndoing irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and flask\\ntowards his flukes dashed them together like two rolling husks on a\\nsurfbeaten beach and then diving down into the sea disappeared in a\\nboiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chips of\\nthe wrecks danced round and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly\\nstirred bowl of punch\\n\\nwhile the two crews were yet circling in the waters reaching out after\\nthe revolving linetubs oars and other floating furniture while\\naslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial twitching\\nhis legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks and stubb was\\nlustily singing out for some one to ladle him up and while the old\\nmans linenow partingadmitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to\\nrescue whom he couldin that wild simultaneousness of a thousand\\nconcreted perilsahabs yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards\\nheaven by invisible wiresas arrowlike shooting perpendicularly\\nfrom the sea the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its\\nbottom and sent it turning over and over into the air till it fell\\nagaingunwale downwardsand ahab and his men struggled out from under\\nit like seals from a seaside cave\\n\\nthe first uprising momentum of the whalemodifying its direction as he\\nstruck the surfaceinvoluntarily launched him along it to a little\\ndistance from the centre of the destruction he had made and with his\\nback to it he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from\\nside to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip or\\ncrumb of the boats touched his skin his tail swiftly drew back and\\ncame sideways smiting the sea but soon as if satisfied that his work\\nfor that time was done he pushed his pleated forehead through the\\nocean and trailing after him the intertangled lines continued his\\nleeward way at a travellers methodic pace\\n\\nas before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight again\\ncame bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up the\\nfloating mariners tubs oars and whatever else could be caught at\\nand safely landed them on her decks some sprained shoulders wrists\\nand ankles livid contusions wrenched harpoons and lances\\ninextricable intricacies of rope shattered oars and planks all these\\nwere there but no fatal or even serious ill seemed

well talk tomorrow\\nnay tonight when the white whale lies down there tied by head and\\ntail\\n\\nhe gave the word and still gazing round him was steadily lowered\\nthrough the cloven blue air to the deck\\n\\nin due time the boats were lowered but as standing in his shallops\\nstern ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved to the\\nmatewho held one of the tackleropes on deckand bade him pause\\n\\nstarbuck\\n\\nsir\\n\\nfor the third time my souls ship starts upon this voyage starbuck\\n\\naye sir thou wilt have it so\\n\\nsome ships sail from their ports and ever afterwards

a voice from the low cabinwindow\\nthere o master my master come back\\n\\nbut ahab heard nothing for his own voice was highlifted then and the\\nboat leaped on\\n\\nyet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when\\nnumbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath\\nthe hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars every time\\nthey dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with\\ntheir bites it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whaleboats\\nin those swarming seas the sharks at times apparently following them\\nin the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of\\nmarching regiments in the east but these were the first sharks that\\nhad been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first\\ndescried and whether it was that ahabs crew were all such\\ntigeryellow barbarians and therefore their flesh more musky to the\\nsenses of the sharksa matter sometimes well known to affect\\nthemhowever it was they seemed to follow that one boat without\\nmolesting the others\\n\\nheart of wrought steel murmured starbuck gazing over the side and\\nfollowing with his eyes the receding boatcanst thou yet ring boldly\\nto that sightlowering thy keel among ravening sharks and followed by\\nthem openmouthed to the chase and this the critical third dayfor\\nwhen three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit be\\nsure the first is the morning the second the noon and the third the\\nevening and the end of that thingbe that end what it may oh my god\\nwhat is this that shoots through me and leaves me so deadly calm yet\\nexpectantfixed at the top of a shudder future things swim before me\\nas in empty outlines and skeletons all the past is somehow grown dim\\nmary girl thou fadest in pale glories behind me boy i seem to see\\nbut thy eyes grown wondrous blue strangest problems of life seem\\nclearing but clouds sweep betweenis my journeys end coming

away with\\nitwheres the old man now seest thou that sight oh ahabshudder\\nshudder\\n\\nthe boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mastheadsa\\ndownward pointed arm ahab knew that the whale had sounded but\\nintending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way a\\nlittle sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining the\\nprofoundest silence as the headbeat waves hammered and hammered\\nagainst the opposing bow\\n\\ndrive drive in your nails oh ye waves to their uttermost heads\\ndrive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin and\\nno hearse can be mineand hemp only can kill me ha ha\\n\\nsuddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles then\\nquickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice\\nswiftly rising to the surface a low rumbling sound was heard a\\nsubterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with\\ntrailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwise\\nbut obliquely from the sea shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist\\nit hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fell swamping\\nback into the deep crushed thirty feet upwards the waters flashed for\\nan instant like heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower of\\nflakes leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the\\nmarble trunk of the whale\\n\\ngive way cried ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forward to\\nthe attack but maddened by yesterdays fresh irons that corroded in\\nhim moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell\\nfrom heaven the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad\\nwhite forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together\\nas head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once more\\nflailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two\\nmates boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows\\nbut leaving ahabs almost without a scar\\n\\nwhile daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks and as the\\nwhale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank as he\\nshot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up lashed round\\nand round to the fishs back pinioned in the turns upon turns in\\nwhich during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of\\nthe lines around him the half torn body of the parsee was seen his\\nsable raiment frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old\\nahab\\n\\nthe harpoon dropped from his hand\\n\\nbefooled befooleddrawing in a long lean breathaye parsee i see\\nthee againaye and thou goest before and this _this_ then is the\\nhearse that thou didst promise but i hold thee to the last letter of\\nthy word where is the second hearse away mates to the ship those\\nboats are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to me\\nif not ahab is enough to diedown men the first thing that but\\noffers to jump from this boat i stand in that thing i harpoon ye are\\nnot other men but my arms and my legs and so obey mewheres the\\nwhale gone down again\\n\\nbut he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent upon escaping with the\\ncorpse he bore and as if the particular place of the last encounter\\nhad been but a stage in his leeward voyage moby dick was now again\\nsteadily swimming forward and had almost passed the shipwhich thus\\nfar had been sailing in the contrary direction to him though for the\\npresent her headway had been stopped he seemed swimming with his\\nutmost velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight\\npath in the sea\\n\\noh ahab cried starbuck not too late is it even now the third\\nday to desist see moby dick seeks thee not it is thou thou that\\nmadly seekest him\\n\\nsetting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat was swiftly impelled\\nto leeward by both oars and canvas and at last when ahab was sliding\\nby the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish starbucks face as he\\nleaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about and\\nfollow him not too swiftly at a judicious interval glancing upwards\\nhe saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mounting to the three\\nmastheads while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats\\nwhich had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in\\nrepairing them one after the other through the portholes as he\\nsped he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask busying\\nthemselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances as he saw all\\nthis as he heard the hammers in the broken boats far other hammers\\nseemed driving a nail into his heart but he rallied and now marking\\nthat the vane or flag was gone from the mainmasthead he shouted to\\ntashtego who had just gained that perch to descend again for another\\nflag and a hammer and nails and so nail it to the mast\\n\\nwhether fagged by the three days running chase and the resistance to\\nhis swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was some\\nlatent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the white\\nwhales way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidly\\nnearing him once more though indeed the whales last start had not\\nbeen so long a one as before and still as ahab glided over the waves\\nthe unpitying sharks accompanied him and so pertinaciously stuck to\\nthe boat and so continually bit at the plying oars that the blades\\nbecame jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea at\\nalmost every dip\\n\\nheed them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars pull\\non tis the better rest the sharks jaw than the yielding water\\n\\nbut at every bite sir the thin blades grow smaller and smaller\\n\\nthey will last long enough pull onbut who can tellhe\\nmutteredwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on\\nahabbut pull on aye all alive nowwe near him the helm take the\\nhelm let me passand so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward\\nto the bows of the still flying boat\\n\\nat length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging along with\\nthe white whales flank he seemed strangely oblivious of its\\nadvanceas the whale sometimes willand ahab was fairly within the\\nsmoky mountain mist which thrown off from the whales spout curled\\nround his great monadnock hump he was even thus close to him when\\nwith body arched back and both arms lengthwise highlifted to the\\npoise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the\\nhated whale as both steel and curse sank to the socket as if sucked\\ninto a morass moby dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled his\\nnigh flank against the bow and without staving a hole in it so\\nsuddenly canted the boat over that had it not been for the elevated\\npart of the gunwale to which he then clung ahab would once more have\\nbeen tossed into the sea as it was three of the oarsmenwho foreknew\\nnot the precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for\\nits effectsthese were flung out but so fell that in an instant two\\nof them clutched the gunwale again and rising to its level on a\\ncombing wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the third man\\nhelplessly dropping astern but still afloat and swimming\\n\\nalmost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated\\ninstantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through the weltering\\nsea but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with\\nthe line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their\\nseats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line\\nfelt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air\\n\\nwhat breaks in me some sinew crackstis whole again oars oars\\nburst in upon him\\n\\nhearing the tremendous rush of the seacrashing boat the whale wheeled\\nround to present his blank forehead at bay but in that evolution\\ncatching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing\\nin it the source of all his persecutions bethinking itit may bea\\nlarger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing\\nprow smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam\\n\\nahab staggered his hand smote his forehead i grow blind hands\\nstretch out before me that i may yet grope my way ist night\\n\\nthe whale the ship cried the cringing oarsmen\\n\\noars oars slope downwards to thy depths o sea that ere it be for\\never too late ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark i\\nsee the ship the ship dash on my men will ye not save my ship\\n\\nbut as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the\\nsledgehammering seas the before whalesmitten bowends of two planks\\nburst

bewildering\\nmediums saw her sidelong fading phantom as in the gaseous fata\\nmorgana only the uppermost masts out of water while fixed by\\ninfatuation or fidelity or fate to their once lofty perches the\\npagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea\\nand now concentric circles seized the lone boat itself and all its\\ncrew and each floating oar and every lancepole and spinning\\nanimate and inanimate all round and round in one vortex carried the\\nsmallest chip of the pequod out of sight\\n\\nbut as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the\\nsunken head of the indian at the mainmast leaving a few inches of the\\nerect spar yet visible together with long streaming yards of the flag\\nwhich calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroying\\nbillows they almost touchedat that instant a red arm and a hammer\\nhovered backwardly uplifted in the open air in the act of nailing the\\nflag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar a skyhawk that\\ntauntingly had followed the maintruck downwards from its natural home\\namong the stars pecking at the flag and incommoding tashtego there\\nthis bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between\\nthe hammer and the wood and simultaneously feeling that etherial\\nthrill the submerged savage beneath in his deathgasp kept his\\nhammer frozen there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic\\nshrieks and his imperial beak thrust upwards and his whole captive\\nform folded in the flag of ahab went down with his ship which like\\nsatan would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of\\nheaven along with her and helmeted herself with it\\n\\nnow small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf a sullen\\nwhite surf beat against its
